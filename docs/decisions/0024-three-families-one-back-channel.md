# 0024: Three pattern families on one surface, and one back channel

Status: provisional
Date: 2026-09-13
Relates to: the owner's restatement of the model; [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §1, §6a, §6b, §7;
[0018](0018-minimal-broker.md) §4.3, §4.6; [0023](0023-completion-is-a-cursor.md) §4.2-§4.5;
[PATTERNS.md](../PATTERNS.md) §1.2, §1.11; [PROTOCOL.md](../PROTOCOL.md) §4.1, §6.5;
[GUARANTEES.md](../GUARANTEES.md) §1, §2; [INVARIANTS.md](../INVARIANTS.md).

## 1. The question

[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §1 opens with "weida is three layers plus adapters" and an
ASCII stack: L0 stream core, L1 patterns, L2 broker semantics. The owner named what is wrong with
that as a description of the thing being built: "was ich ein wenig kompliziert wieder zu geben
finde ist die komplizierte **zwiebelung**", and then gave the shape that replaces it — streams as
the base and "ein neues **gesamtset** stream patterns und message patterns und viele davon sind
ueberlappend", with broker patterns as a third set, and: "das ist die weida user api stream,
message, broker **nach freier wahl**".

Two more things came with it, and both are decisions rather than presentation. The back channel:
"async datagrams als back channel… am ende sende ich halt mit jeder nachricht mit, hey, ich
interessiere mich fuer updates ueber write, sync, process, custom-xyz, in cursor form… optional
mit nagle und optional **fin-only**". And the point that makes streaming the headline rather than
a feature: a video upload must arrive whole at the end, but the sender "kann eigentlich zufrieden
sein sobald mir der loadbalancer, der ja der erste hop ist, sein read fin ack ueber standard quic
uebermittelt… und der loadbalancer muss dafuer **nicht die gesamte nachricht materialisieren**".

So: is the layer model the right story, where does the cursor back channel live, and what does the
system actually claim about materialization.

## 2. The evidence, condensed

**The onion is real in one direction only.** The dependency direction is genuine and worth
keeping: `weida-broker`'s "whole dependency list is `weida`", nothing in the core may depend on
it, "and a brokerless" program links none of it [ARCHITECTURE §4]. But the documents already deny
that this makes a stack the user climbs: "The framework provides one messaging model. Brokerless
peer-to-peer operation and brokered operation use the same patterns and semantics… it does not
introduce a second programming model", and §1's own gloss, "**L2 is a layer, not a fork**: it adds
guarantees to the same patterns rather than a second way of writing programs". A reader who is
told "three layers" and then told "but not a stack you climb" has been given work to do that the
design does not require.

**The overlap the owner describes is already visible in the pattern table.** [ARCHITECTURE §6b]
maps the family — REQ/REP, DEALER/ROUTER, PUSH/PULL, PUB/SUB, PAIR, BUS, SURVEYOR/RESPONDENT —
onto weida constructs, and every row is expressed in terms of the *two stream kinds*: "one
exchange", "one-way transfer, round-robin out", "one-way fan-out plus SUBSCRIBE". So a pattern is
not a layer above streams; it is a **vocabulary over the same two primitives**, which is exactly
why §6b could call building one "a decision about API surface… and not about the protocol".

**A message is already defined as a stream, not as a different thing.** [PATTERNS §1.11]:
"**a message is a stream that reached FIN**", so a queue's unit is a completed stream, and "half a
frame is not a frame" [PATTERNS §4.1] is the general rule. Nothing in the message world needs a
representation the stream world lacks.

**QUIC datagrams exist, and their loss policy is the one an absolute cursor wants.** quinn
0.11.11 `Connection::send_datagram` transmits "an unreliable, unordered application datagram…
They may be lost or delivered out of order, and `data` must both fit inside a single QUIC packet
and be smaller than the maximum dictated by the peer", and — the sentence that matters —
"**Previously queued datagrams which are still unsent may be discarded to make space for this
datagram, in order of oldest to newest**". `max_datagram_size()` "Returns `None` if datagrams are
unsupported by the peer or disabled locally… if the peer's limit is large this is guaranteed to be
a little over a kilobyte at minimum", and `datagram_receive_buffer_size(None)` disables incoming
datagrams entirely, with the peer "forbidden to send single datagrams larger than this size".

Read that against [0023 §4.3b]: cursors are **absolute**, so "a later cursor for a level
supersedes every earlier one". Dropping the oldest unsent datagram to make room for the newest is
therefore not a loss at all — it discards exactly the information that the newer datagram makes
redundant. The transport's congestion behaviour and the cursor's algebra agree without either
being designed for the other.

**And the receipt the owner wants to be satisfied by is already the L0 primitive.** `Delivery` is
"the transport receipt — QUIC's own fin-acknowledgement" [ARCHITECTURE §1], and
[PATTERNS §1.2] documents what it implies beyond the flow-control window: for a payload of `p`
bytes against a window of `w`, it cannot resolve until the reader consumed at least `p - w` bytes.
Nothing about it requires the peer to have *kept* the bytes.

## 3. Options considered

| Option | Story told to a user | Named loss |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A — three families on one surface: stream, message, broker, chosen freely; the cursor is one mechanism across all of them** | "weida has two stream kinds and three vocabularies over them. Pick the vocabulary your problem has. Ask for the cursors you care about." | The dependency direction stops being visible in the headline, so §1 must state it separately (it does, in §4's crate map, and this note keeps a one-line version) |
| B — keep the L0/L1/L2 onion as the primary story | "learn the stack" | Contradicts the project's own "one messaging model, not a second programming model", and misleads twice: it suggests messages are *above* streams (they are the same streams, finished) and that a broker user is further from the metal (a broker is an ordinary weida user) |
| C — two products: a stream API and a message API | "choose a library" | Precisely the fork [ARCHITECTURE §1] forbids, and it would duplicate every pattern |
| D — message patterns only, streams as an implementation detail | ZeroMQ's story | Throws away the differentiator. The video case shows why: a message API forces materialization at some hop, and the whole point is that no hop has to |

## 4. Decision

**Option A**, plus two mechanism decisions that follow from it.

**4.1 The user API is one surface with three vocabularies, chosen freely.** Not a stack to climb:

| Vocabulary | What you get | What it is made of |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **stream** | `Peer`, `Acceptor`, one-way transfers, exchanges, `Delivery`, cancel | QUIC's two stream kinds, nothing invented |
| **message** | the full ZeroMQ/nanomsg family — Req/Rep, Push/Pull, Pub/Sub, PAIR, SURVEY, BUS | the same two stream kinds, with a selection policy and a name |
| **broker** | queues, confirms, subscriptions, redelivery | an ordinary weida process, using the two above plus a store |

The sets **overlap on purpose**: Req/Rep is a stream pattern *and* a message pattern, because a
request is a stream and a completed request is a message. What distinguishes the message
vocabulary is not a layer boundary but the assumption that the payload is **whole** before it is
used — and [PATTERNS §1.11] already says what that means: a message is a stream that reached FIN.

The dependency direction survives as a single sentence rather than a diagram: **`weida` never
depends on the broker, and a brokerless program links none of it.** That is a packaging fact, not
a user's mental model.

**4.2 The cursor back channel is per-message, requested by the sender, and changes no pattern.**
A sender states, with the message, the levels it wants reported — `written`, `synced`,
`processed`, and application stages above 15 ([0023 §4.3a]) — and the reporting side honours
them at a granularity of its own. This is the owner's framing and it is a **feature, not a
semantic**: without it an application that wants progress builds an explicit back-propagation
stream and a correlation scheme by hand; with QUIC it is nearly free. No pattern changes shape
because cursors were added, and a pattern used without them behaves exactly as it does today.

**4.3 Two modes on the wire, three shapes of report, and `final-only` is what makes the classic
model a configuration.**

| Mode | What is reported | When it is right |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `progress` (`0`) | records as a level advances, at the reporter's own granularity | the default: cheap, and lossless because cursors are absolute |
| `final-only` (`1`) | exactly one record per level, at the end | a message-shaped application that wants a verdict and nothing else |

**The granularity is not a third mode, and an earlier draft of this table got that wrong.** It
listed `per_chunk` and `coalesced { bytes, interval }` as separate wire modes — but §4.5 of
[0023] says the granularity is the **reporter's own number and is never negotiated**, and a
`{ bytes, interval }` pair in the sender's header is exactly a negotiated granularity. The two
cannot both hold. So the wire carries which levels and *whether progress is wanted at all*, and
`weida::Reporter::with_granularity` carries how finely — `per_chunk` is that granularity set to
zero, and the default is 1 MiB or 100 ms, whichever comes first. Nothing is lost: a reporter's
`finish` flushes the latest offset per level before the FIN, so coalescing can drop every
intermediate record and the reader still ends at the same number.

`final-only` is the important one politically: the whole-message acknowledgement that RabbitMQ,
AMQP and MQTT all have is **this system's degenerate case**, not a different mechanism. A
migrating application asks for `final-only` and gets what it had; nothing in the design has to
argue that whole-message verdicts are obsolete. What it does *not* do is reproduce the classic
confirm's bytes: a broker's publisher confirm is still DATA key `8` on an exchange's reply half
(B-201), untouched, and `final-only` on an exchange needs no cursor stream at all.

**4.4 A cursor never shares a stream with payload.** Two requirements from the owner, in order.
First, reliability: "auf die ack muss man sich trotzdem verlassen koennen, wenigstens auf das fin"
— so the carrier is a stream, not a datagram. Second, separation: "fuer ack brauche ich einen
**getrennten stream**" — and this is not a preference, it is forced by the frame shape. A DATA
frame is "header followed by opaque payload bytes until FIN" [PROTOCOL §4], so:

- a responder that **streams** a reply while still reporting on the request would have to
  interleave control frames into payload bytes, which the shape forbids and which would cost the
  zero-copy property that makes payload opaque in the first place;
- a cursor about the **reply** direction flows from requester to responder, where the initiating
  half is already finished — no carrier exists at all.

Either blocker alone settles it. **Cursors get their own unidirectional stream: frame kind `6`, a
head frame naming the payload stream it reports about, then `(level, offset)` records until FIN**
([0023 §4.3]). **The identifier is a `report_id` the ordering DATA header allocates**, not
QUIC's own `StreamId`, and the correction came from building it (B-233). Two reasons, either
sufficient. A `StreamId` exists only on QUIC: `handle_local` carries no stream-kind
vocabulary at all [0012 §4.3], so the inproc, `AF_UNIX` and named-pipe transports would have
had no identifier to name — and a back channel that works on one of four transports is not a
mechanism. And a `StreamId` is chosen by the *peer*, so a receiver would have to accept an id
it never issued and map it; a `report_id` is allocated by the side that **orders** the report,
so the lookup finds state that side created, and an id that was never handed out allocates
nothing (`PROTOCOL.md` §6.7 rule 3). It is still not application-visible and still not the
per-transfer correlation machinery [ARCHITECTURE §1] deleted: there is no pending table, no
cancellation frame and no reply-arrival notification, because closing the payload stream ends
the reporting and the FIN of the cursor stream says there is no more.

**4.4a The answer to "uni, uni und bidi — oder grundsaetzlich bidi?": the payload topology does
not change at all.** It is the pattern's business, and the cursor stream is orthogonal to it.

| What is sent | Payload streams | Cursor streams |
| --- | --- | --- |
| one-way transfer, nothing ordered | 1 uni | none — the transport receipt and nothing more [0018 §4.6] |
| one-way transfer, cursors ordered | 1 uni | 1 uni, opened by the receiver |
| exchange, nothing ordered | 1 bidi: request on the initiating half, reply or ERROR on the reply half | none |
| exchange, cursors ordered on the request | the same 1 bidi | 1 uni, opened by the responder |
| exchange, cursors ordered both ways | the same 1 bidi | 2 uni, one per reporter |

Two things this table says out loud. **A Push producer keeps its unidirectional transfer and still
gets a reliable verdict**, which the earlier draft of this note got wrong by making an ordered
cursor turn the transfer into an exchange: no pattern changes shape to gain cursors. And **the
reply half stays the application's**: an exchange's reply is the application's answer, so the
broker's confirm — DATA key `8` on a reply half (B-201) — is untouched, and `fin_only` on an
exchange needs no cursor stream at all.

The **second** option the owner raised — always bidi for payload, with the reply on its own uni —
is rejected for the reason [ARCHITECTURE §1] records as one of the project's two founding
removals: "the correlation machinery existed only because replies rode separate streams… machinery
whose entire job was to undo a choice made one layer down". A reply on its own stream must be
matched back; a reply on the bidi's other half is matched by the stream. That stays.

One subtlety, recorded because it is the kind of thing that is discovered twice: a **bidi**
stream reports in both directions, so one identifier for it would appear ambiguous. With
`report_id` it is not even a question: each side allocates ids from its own space and orders a
report in its own header, so the responder's cursor stream carries the id the *request* header
allocated and the requester's carries the id the *reply* header allocated. No direction field
is needed, and no shared numbering rule either.

**Datagrams are rejected, and the reason is worth keeping.** An earlier draft put progress cursors
on QUIC datagrams, and the analysis stands as far as it went: an absolute cursor can afford loss,
and quinn discards the *oldest* unsent datagram, which is the one a newer cursor makes redundant.
But weigh what it bought. A datagram is not on a stream, so it needed a stream id in its payload
anyway — **the addressing cost was identical to the cursor stream's**. What it saved was per-cursor
overhead; what it cost was the one property the mechanism must have. When the only advantage is
cost and the requirement is reliability, the reliable carrier wins outright.

Two rules survive from that draft unchanged, because they are about the cursor and not its carrier:

1. **Nothing waits on a cursor.** No guarantee is expressed through one, and a peer that receives
   none behaves correctly — it merely learns less. A stalled or unread cursor stream must therefore
   block no transfer, which is a test in B-240.
2. **Coalescing is free**, because the cursors are absolute: a reporter may drop every intermediate
   record and the receiver still ends at the same offset per level [0023 §4.3b]. Reliability and
   batching are not in tension — the stream delivers what is sent, and the reporter decides how
   much that is.

**4.5 Materialization is a per-hop choice, and this is the headline.** The video case states the
property exactly: the uploader is satisfied by the **first hop's** transport receipt, and that hop
— a load balancer — "does not have to materialize the whole message". If every hop in the chain
keeps working in streams, the payload may **never** be materialized anywhere, and the guarantee
each hop gives is still honest, because guarantees are hop-local [GUARANTEES §2],
[0018 §4.3].

So the positioning follows: **weida is first-class messaging, and streaming is the thing to
highlight.** A message system forces a materialization boundary at every hop that wants to
acknowledge; this one does not, because its acknowledgements are cursors over bytes rather than
verdicts about objects. The invariant that payloads "may remain streams end-to-end"
[INVARIANTS] stops being a constraint the implementation must respect and becomes the feature
the project leads with.

**4.6 The synergy, stated because it is the reason the two halves belong together.** A
message-shaped user would normally get one acknowledgement, after FIN, because that is when a
message exists. Because the same mechanism reports cursors, that user gets **progress for free**:
an upload's bar, a queue's drain position, a consumer's stage — with no extra API, no extra stream
and no correlation scheme. That is what makes the back channel worth a frame: it serves the stream
world's necessity and the message world's convenience with one mechanism.

**4.7 What does not change.** No pattern's semantics, no guarantee, no wire vocabulary for
patterns: PAIR, SURVEY and BUS are still API surface over the same two stream kinds (B-236,
B-237, B-238). `Delivery` keeps its exact meaning, transport state stays hidden
[0023 §4.1], and adapter honesty is untouched — a foreign protocol that has one whole-message
ack maps to `fin_only` and says so.

**4.8 Status is `provisional`, and what would change it.** The cost of a cursor stream **per
payload stream** is the measurement attached to §4.4. At very high fan-out — millions of small
messages, each ordering cursors — a stream per transfer doubles stream accounting, and the
alternative is one long-lived cursor stream per connection carrying records for many payload
streams, which the head frame's `report_id` already makes expressible. That is a pure optimization
of the same design, not a different one, and it needs a number: streams created per second and
memory per in-flight report, against the same workload with cursors off.

## 5. Consequences and follow-ups

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §1** is rewritten around §4.1: three vocabularies on one
  surface, the dependency direction as one sentence, the L0/L1/L2 names kept only where they
  describe crate boundaries.
- **[PATTERNS.md](../PATTERNS.md)** gains the sentence that the families overlap and why, next to
  §1.11's "a message is a stream that reached FIN".
- **[PROTOCOL.md](../PROTOCOL.md) §4** gains kind `6` as a unidirectional stream whose shape is
  "head frame, then records until FIN" — the first such shape, since every other kind is
  header-only or header-plus-payload — and the statement that nothing waits on a cursor. §4.1 is
  unchanged, and no datagram extension is used.
- **[0023](0023-completion-is-a-cursor.md) §4.3** is rewritten onto the separate stream, and its
  "a one-way transfer gets no cursors" becomes "a one-way transfer can be reported on", which is
  what the separation buys.
- **Backlog.** Three items, links relative to `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

### B-239 — The three ack modes, including `fin_only`
kind: code | size: 60 | status: blocked | needs: [B-233]
acceptance: a sender states per message which levels it wants and in which mode — `per_chunk`, `coalesced { bytes, interval }`, `fin_only` ([0024](0024-three-families-one-back-channel.md) §4.3) — and the reporting side honours it, with `coalesced` proved lossless: a reporter that coalesces 100 advances into 3 frames leaves the receiver with the same final offset per level as one that reports all 100, because cursors are absolute. `fin_only` produces **exactly one** cursor frame per level and is the mode an adapter with a whole-message ack maps to; a test asserts that `fin_only` plus a `Stored` level is byte-for-byte the classic confirm, so the migration story is real rather than asserted.
note: the mode is configuration, not protocol: the frame of B-233 is unchanged by all three.

### B-240 — The cursor stream, orthogonal to every pattern
kind: code | size: 60 | status: blocked | needs: [B-239]
acceptance: the reporting side opens a uni cursor stream per payload stream it reports on, and the payload topology is **unchanged** in every case ([0024](0024-three-families-one-back-channel.md) §4.4a). Proved where it is surprising: a Push transfer with cursors ordered is still **one unidirectional** payload stream with unchanged round-robin selection, refusal behaviour and delivery semantics, plus a reliable verdict on a separate stream; with none ordered it is byte-for-byte today's transfer. An exchange reporting both directions has **two** cursor streams and one bidi, and a test asserts that the pair (opener, stream id) disambiguates them without a direction field. Two load-bearing negatives: a stalled or never-read cursor stream blocks no transfer, and a peer that ignores cursor streams entirely completes every transfer and every guarantee.
note: the reply half stays the application's, so the broker's confirm (DATA key `8`, B-201) is untouched and `fin_only` on an exchange needs no cursor stream at all.

### B-241 — ARCHITECTURE §1: three vocabularies instead of an onion
kind: spec | size: 30 | status: done | needs: []
acceptance: [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §1 no longer opens with "weida is three layers" and a stack diagram, but with the surface a user actually chooses from — stream, message, broker — the overlap between the families and the reason for it, and the dependency direction as a single sentence rather than a picture. The L0/L1/L2 names survive only where they name crate boundaries, which is what they are.
note: done. The onion was never wrong about dependencies and always wrong as a user's mental model, and the document said so itself two screens further down: "L2 is a layer, not a fork".

## 6. What this note does not decide

- **Whether many payload streams ever share one cursor stream.** §4.8's optimization: the head
  frame's `report_id` makes it expressible, and the measurement decides whether it is worth a second
  code path.
- **Whether a broker ever *requires* cursors.** It prescribes which levels it reports; whether it
  refuses a producer that asks for none is a broker policy question, and queue admission
  [0018 §4.6] does not need one.
- **Backpressure on the back channel.** A reporter that produces cursors faster than the peer
  consumes them is bounded by the datagram send buffer today; whether it should also be bounded by
  a rate is §4.8's measurement.
- **Anything about the stream primitives.** They are unchanged, and that is the point of calling
  them the base.
