# 0012: Grouping local connections into a peer

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-09-11
Relates to: [0010](0010-local-transport.md) §4.2, §4.4; [0008](0008-session-identity.md) §4.1,
§4.2, §4.5; [0002](0002-control-and-bulk-separation.md) §6.2; B-038, B-039

## 1. The question

[0010](0010-local-transport.md) §4.2 decided that on a local transport **the OS connection is
the stream**: one connection per transfer, no multiplexer, because a multiplexer is
reimplementing QUIC's stream layer in the one place the project set out not to (0010 Option C,
rejected). Implementing it exposed what that sentence does not say.

A QUIC connection is symmetric: either side opens streams whenever it needs one. An accepted
`AF_UNIX` connection is not. The dialling side can connect again; the accepting side has
nothing to connect *to*. Three things need a stream from the accepting side:

- **Its own HELLO.** `docs/PROTOCOL.md` §2.1 keeps the HELLO exchange on local transports and
  fences the version with the `versions` intersection instead of ALPN. Both sides must send one.
- **Pub/Sub fan-out.** A publisher writes one DATA frame per matching subscriber, each on its
  own stream (`docs/PROTOCOL.md` §9.5), toward a subscriber that dialled *it*.
- **Everything per connection that is really per peer.** Sequence scopes, the dedup window, the
  parked drain receipts and `Agreed` are per `ConnCtx` today; with one connection per transfer
  each of them would be born and die with a single transfer, which is not what
  [0001](0001-sequence-field.md) §7.1 or [0009](0009-drain.md) §4.2 mean.

The in-process transport has none of these problems, because a channel pair is symmetric. So
this note is about the socket transports only, and the answer has to fit named pipes too:
whatever it is, B-039 inherits it.

## 2. The evidence, condensed

**Descriptor passing is not available shape-wide.** Passing one end of a `socketpair()` over a
control connection — the "role A" shape `ipc.md` §11 calls strictly better, and Cap'n Proto's
and Mojo's design — needs `SCM_RIGHTS`. Windows `AF_UNIX` has "no ancillary data and therefore
no handle passing" [ipc §3.6], the trade-off table records handle passing as `DuplicateHandle`
only and "not on `AF_UNIX`" [ipc §11], and Wayland is named as "a protocol that structurally
cannot run on a transport without `SCM_RIGHTS`" [ipc §7] — which is exactly the property weida
must not acquire if B-039 is to exist. `SCM_RIGHTS` is also still unstable in Rust `std`
[ipc §11], and `crates/weida` forbids `unsafe_code`, so taking it means a new dependency for a
capability one of the three target platforms cannot offer at all.

**A token is the shape the sheet records for exactly this problem.** Where the kernel cannot
authenticate the second connection, the surveyed systems use a nonce or token: D-Bus's
`nonce-tcp` "is TCP plus a simple authentication step intended to ensure that only clients with
read access to a filesystem [nonce file] can connect" [ipc §7, §11], and Tailscale's sandboxed
Darwin fallback is "loopback TCP on `127.0.0.1:0` with a random token and a same-user proof
file" [ipc §11]. Both pair a token with a kernel-checkable fact rather than relying on the token
alone.

**The kernel-checkable fact exists on both socket platforms, with a known asymmetry.**
`SO_PEERCRED` yields `{pid, uid, gid}` captured at `connect()`/`listen()` rather than at send
time [ipc §1.5]; `LOCAL_PEERCRED` returns effective UID and groups and **no PID**, and Apple's
advice is to bind authorization to the audit token rather than a PID [ipc §2.2, §7]. Windows has
the client's token through `ImpersonateNamedPipeClient`, and PID and computer name are
observations rather than authentication [ipc §3.3, §7].

**Named pipes remove the reverse-connection problem only by half.** A pipe instance also runs
client-to-server; instances "vanish when the last handle closes" so there is no stale endpoint
[ipc §3.1], and the instance count is capped at 1-255 [ipc §3.1]. Nothing in the sheet gives a
server a way to initiate toward a pipe client either.

**Precedent for parked reverse connections.** The sheet does not record one: D-Bus, Wayland,
PostgreSQL, Redis and the SSH agent are all request/response or client-driven-stream protocols
over one long-lived connection [ipc §7], and the one system that needs server-initiated bulk
transfer — Wayland — solves it with `SCM_RIGHTS`, which is the route closed above. The absence
is itself evidence: a reverse pool is weida's own construction and must be justified as such,
not by precedent.

## 3. Options considered

| Option | Shape | Named loss |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — socketpair over a control connection | either side mints a pair per transfer and passes an end | needs `SCM_RIGHTS`: unavailable on Windows `AF_UNIX` [ipc §3.6] and on named pipes, unstable in `std` [ipc §11], and `unsafe`-or-dependency here. B-039 could not inherit it |
| B — control connection + token-bound transfer connections | the first connection is the peer; each further one proves membership with a token *and* matching kernel credentials | a 16-byte token per peer is new L0 state, and server-initiated streams still need an answer |
| C — one long-lived connection, framed transfers | what D-Bus, Wayland and PostgreSQL do [ipc §7] | this is 0010's rejected Option C: a multiplexer with stream ids, flow control and resets |
| D — the client also binds a socket and tells the server | symmetric addressing | doubles the socket hygiene (path budget, permissions, stale files) on the side least able to own a directory [ipc §1.2, §7], and named pipes would need the client to be a server |
| E — B plus **parked reverse connections** | B, and the client parks spare connections the server may take when it needs a stream | a parked connection is a file descriptor held open for a stream that may never come; running out is a drop |

## 4. Decision

Option E: B for the direction that works, plus a bounded pool of parked connections for the
direction that does not.

1. **The first connection a client opens to a local endpoint is the peer's control
   connection.** HELLO travels both ways on it — the dialling side writes its HELLO frame, the
   accepting side writes its own back on the same connection — and it lives as long as the peer
   does. Everything the runtime holds per connection today (`Agreed`, sequence scopes, the dedup
   window, the parked drain receipts, the subscription registry entry) belongs to it, which is
   how a per-peer guarantee survives a transport whose connections are per transfer. This is
   [0002](0002-control-and-bulk-separation.md) §6.2's control connection with its local
   consequence made explicit; 0010 §4.2 already permits it ("one more local connection,
   distinguished by nothing but its use").

2. **Every further connection carries a group token in a local preamble, and is accepted only
   if the kernel agrees.** The server issues **16 random bytes** in its HELLO reply on the
   control connection. A transfer connection opens with that token, and the server accepts it
   only when the token matches a live control connection **and** the kernel credentials of the
   new connection match that control connection's: the uid always, and the pid where the
   platform reports one. A mismatch is refused and the connection closed with `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`'s
   sibling `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`; nothing is dispatched from an unbound connection. This is the
   local analogue of the fingerprint binding that groups a peer's QUIC connections
   ([0002](0002-control-and-bulk-separation.md) §6.3, [0008](0008-session-identity.md) §4.2),
   with the kernel in the prover's role that 0010 §4.4 gave it.

   The token is **not** a credential and MUST NOT be treated as one: it names a group, the
   kernel says who is asking, and the two together are what admit a connection. A token that
   leaked to another uid still fails the credential check; a peer with the right uid and no
   token is a *different* peer, not an impostor.

3. **A transfer connection is dispatched by path alone**, which `docs/PROTOCOL.md` §2.1 already
   specifies for local transports: the accepting side reads the preamble and the DATA header,
   looks the path up, and the pattern registered there says whether a reply is expected. A
   replier answers on the same connection; a puller or publisher path never writes back. The
   stream kinds of §4.1 are a QUIC vocabulary and have no place on the wire here.

4. **Server-initiated streams ride on parked reverse connections.** A client that subscribes
   parks spare connections carrying a `reverse` preamble with the same token; the server takes
   one when it needs to open a stream toward that peer, and the client replenishes what is
   consumed. The pool is bounded by a named `Limits` field, `max_parked_reverse`, on both sides,
   and counts against `max_local_streams` like any other live local connection.

   **A server that needs a stream and finds no parked connection drops that copy**, exactly as a
   publisher drops a copy for a subscriber whose byte budget is exhausted, and counts it in the
   same place (`Publisher::dropped`, [GUARANTEES.md](../GUARANTEES.md) §6 `Drop`). This is the
   honest mapping: fan-out is already the one place weida answers overload by discarding, and a
   reverse pool that blocks the publisher instead would make a local subscriber able to stall a
   publisher that serves remote ones.

5. **What the token is not.** Sixteen bytes per peer is new L0 state, and
   [0008](0008-session-identity.md) §4.5 forbids session state at L0. The rule survives because
   the token **binds connections and resumes nothing**: it carries no subscriptions, no sequence
   position and no dedup window; it is meaningless once the control connection closes; and a
   reconnecting peer gets a new one and starts over. That is precisely the line 0008 §4.2 draws
   for the fingerprint — "the identity that spans connections" — with the difference that a
   fingerprint is proved cryptographically and a token is merely unguessable, which is why §4.2
   does not let it stand alone.

6. **B-039 inherits this unchanged.** A named pipe instance is opened by the client exactly as a
   socket connection is; the first instance is the control connection, further instances carry
   the same preamble, and the credential check reads the client's token through
   `ImpersonateNamedPipeClient` [ipc §3.3] instead of `SO_PEERCRED`. No descriptor passing is
   required anywhere, which was the constraint that killed Option A.

7. **Named losses.** (a) A local peer costs at least two connections — the control connection
   plus one per live transfer — against `max_local_streams` (255, Windows' instance cap
   [ipc §3.1]). (b) The token is unguessable, not proved; the kernel check is what makes it
   safe, so a platform that reported no credentials at all could not use this shape. (c) The
   reverse pool trades file descriptors for the ability to receive fan-out, and an exhausted
   pool is a silent-to-the-publisher, counted-at-the-publisher drop. (d) A client that never
   parks a reverse connection cannot receive Pub/Sub at all — which is a *configuration* a
   subscriber chooses, and must be reported rather than inferred.

## 5. Consequences and follow-ups

- **B-038 implements §4.1-§4.3 and §4.7(a)**: the control connection with the HELLO exchange,
  the group token with the credential check, path dispatch on transfer connections, the socket
  hygiene of 0010 §4.5 (explicit mode, unlink-then-bind, the decoded path budget), and
  `IncomingMeta::peer` carrying the local principal. Req/Rep and Push/Pull work over
  `weida+unix://`; Pub/Sub does not.
- **Follow-up item, filed with this note** (as B-048: B-047 is the id this note itself was
  written under, and ids are never reused):

  > ### B-048 — AF_UNIX: parked reverse connections for fan-out
  > kind: code | size: 90 | status: ready | needs: [B-038]
  > acceptance: a subscriber over `weida+unix://` parks spare connections carrying the `reverse`
  > preamble and its group token, bounded by the new `Limits::max_parked_reverse` and counted
  > against `max_local_streams`; the publisher takes one per fan-out copy and the subscriber
  > replenishes; a publisher that finds no parked connection drops that copy and counts it in
  > `Publisher::dropped`, with a test that exhausts the pool and observes the drop; a subscriber
  > that parks nothing is reported at subscribe time rather than silently receiving nothing;
  > GUARANTEES §6 gains the local fan-out row and PROTOCOL §2.1 the `reverse` preamble
  > ([decisions/0012](decisions/0012-local-connection-grouping.md) §4.4).

- **B-039 inherits** §4.1-§4.4 with `ImpersonateNamedPipeClient` in place of `SO_PEERCRED`, and
  should need no new decision.
- **[PROTOCOL.md](../PROTOCOL.md) §2.1** gains the local preamble: what a transfer connection
  sends before its first frame (the token, and later the `reverse` marker), and the rule that an
  unbound connection is refused. This is a *local* framing detail, not a wire-version change:
  nothing about it appears on a QUIC connection.
- **[INVARIANTS.md](../INVARIANTS.md)** gains `max_parked_reverse` as a named bound when B-048
  lands; `max_local_streams` already covers the connections themselves.
- **[GUARANTEES.md](../GUARANTEES.md) §6** records that Pub/Sub over a socket transport depends
  on the reverse pool, and that an exhausted pool is a counted drop.
- **Status was provisional** because the reverse pool of §4.4 had no precedent in the sheets
  and no measurement behind its bound. B-048 has run: the shape holds unchanged, the shared
  Pub/Sub test body passes over `AF_UNIX` exactly as over QUIC and inproc
  (`pub_sub_over_unix`), an exhausted pool is a counted drop that leaves the subscription
  alive (`an_exhausted_reverse_pool_drops_the_copy_and_counts_it`), and a subscriber that
  parks nothing is refused at subscribe time
  (`a_subscriber_that_parks_nothing_is_refused_at_connect`). The one thing the
  implementation sharpened is *when* a replacement is parked: on the first byte the peer
  writes, not at the end of the copy, so a long transfer does not shrink the pool for its
  duration.
