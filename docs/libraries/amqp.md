# AMQP 1.0 (OASIS Standard, 29 October 2012) — feature parity

Status: complete against the six clauses of
[0013](../decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.7, read for AMQP. This document is the
sixth clause itself — the row-by-row table — and §11 gives the other five their verdicts.

The library is two crates: `weida-amqp-codec`, the sans-I/O codec whose `[dependencies]` is
empty, and `weida-amqp`, the client on top of it. Neither depends on `weida`; a caller who
wants an AMQP 1.0 client and nothing else uses `weida-amqp` alone
([0013](../decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.3, §4.4).

**This is a client, and the standard defines no server.** AMQP 1.0 "defines no operation to
create, configure, enumerate or delete a node", so a broker cannot be built from the core
standard alone: everything a broker does with a queue is outside it
([0014](../decisions/0014-parallel-libraries.md) §2). Every row below is therefore read as
*the client half*. Where a concept exists at both ends — a terminus's expiry policy, a
delivery state, an unsettled map — the client half is what is present, and the row says so
once rather than in every line.

## 1. What a row means

Three verdicts and no fourth:

- **present** — implemented, with the module or test that carries it named. A present row may
  still say where the behaviour differs, and then the difference is the row.
- **refused with a reason** — the configuration exists in the specification and fails **here,
  at configuration time**, with a message naming why (0013 §4.4 item 4). Nothing is silently
  ignored.
- **absent with a reason** — not implemented and not configurable, with what is missing named.

"Partial" is not a verdict. Where something is present in part, the row says which part is
missing (0013 §4.7 clause 6).

**Versions every measured claim was measured against.** `fe2o3-amqp` **0.17.0**, the pure-Rust
peer, through its `acceptor` module over loopback TCP, run on 2026-09-12 by
`crates/amqp/weida-amqp/tests/interop_fe2o3.rs` — eight tests, nothing `#[ignore]`d. **RabbitMQ
4.x was not run**: `which rabbitmq-server` is empty on this machine and so are `docker` and
`podman`, so `tests/interop_rabbitmq.rs` is four `#[ignore]`d tests carrying the install
command, and every RabbitMQ column below says *not run* rather than a verdict. Claims about
what the specification *says* cite [`../research/amqp10.md`](../research/amqp10.md), which
cites the five OASIS parts; claims about what a broker does cite that sheet's numbered sources
and are marked as documentation rather than measurement.

## 2. The nine performatives

Part 2 §2.7 defines exactly nine and there is no tenth. All nine are encoded and decoded by
`weida-amqp-codec`'s `performative.rs`, with the field layouts of §2.7.1-§2.7.9 asserted
against the specification's own figures in `tests/golden_performatives.rs`; the client's use of
each is in `weida-amqp`.

| Performative | Verdict | Where, and what the client does with it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open` (`0x10`) | present | `connection.rs`. Every field of §2.7.1 as a field of `ConnectionOptions`. Each negotiated value is read from the end that owns it: the **peer's** `max-frame-size` bounds what this client writes, floored at the 512 octets both peers MUST accept; the **peer's** `channel-max` bounds which channels it may use; and the idle timeout is two independent clocks rather than one agreed number |
| `begin` (`0x11`) | present | `session.rs`. Lowest free outgoing channel, the answering `begin` tying the two independent numberings through `remote-channel`, `handle-max` advertised at 255 |
| `attach` (`0x12`) | present | `link.rs`. Both roles, both settle-mode fields, `source` and `target` as described types, `initial-delivery-count` mandatory for a sender; the answering `attach` is read as **data and not an acknowledgement** — what the peer actually created |
| `flow` (`0x13`) | present | `link.rs`, `window.rs`, `credit.rs`. Both halves: the six session variables that every `flow` carries and the four link variables it may carry; `drain` honoured, `echo` answered exactly once and never with an `echo` |
| `transfer` (`0x14`) | present | `link.rs`. Multi-frame deliveries with `more`, `aborted` on a delivery this end cannot finish, `settled` per delivery under `mixed`, `delivery-tag` a per-link counter, `message-format` 0 |
| `disposition` (`0x15`) | present | `settlement.rs`, `connection.rs`. Ranges of delivery-ids in one frame, all four outcomes, `settled` distinguishing a provisional answer from a final one; offered to every link of the session in the addressed direction, because the frame names no handle |
| `detach` (`0x16`) | present | `link.rs`. `closed` both ways, an error carried, the peer's `detach` **answered** — a link endpoint is destroyed only when both ends have detached |
| `end` (`0x17`) | present | `session.rs`. With and without an error, and the `DISCARDING` state discarding input until the partner's `end` rather than acting on it |
| `close` (`0x18`) | present | `connection.rs`. The last frame ever written, and the queue of already-handed-over frames is flushed before it — see §10 |

## 3. The message: nine sections in one fixed order

Part 3 §3.2 fixes the order and `message.rs` enforces it as a monotonic stage counter: a
section out of order is `SectionOutOfOrder`, a repeat is `DuplicateSection`, and mixing body
kinds is `MixedBodySections`.

| Section | Descriptor | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `header` | `0x70` | present — the five fields, `durable` as the demand it is, `priority` defaulting to 4, both `delivery-count` meanings kept apart |
| `delivery-annotations` | `0x71` | present — one hop only, sender to receiver |
| `message-annotations` | `0x72` | present — travels with the message indefinitely |
| `properties` | `0x73` | present — all thirteen fields, `message-id` and `correlation-id` in all four of their permitted types |
| `application-properties` | `0x74` | present — the section is required to be a map and a repeat is `DuplicateSection`. What is **not** enforced: Part 3 restricts the *values* to simple types (no map, list or array), and this decoder carries whatever the map held rather than refusing a nested one. The restriction is documented on the field; a peer that sends a nested value gets it back unchanged rather than an error |
| `data` | `0x75` | present — one or more, and the bare-message octets reported alongside the decode so a signature can be computed over what arrived |
| `amqp-sequence` | `0x76` | present — one or more |
| `amqp-value` | `0x77` | present — exactly one, any single value |
| `footer` | `0x78` | present — the tail annotations |
| *no body section at all* | — | present as `Body::Empty`, and **marked non-conformant** in the type's own documentation: Part 3 §3.2 enumerates the body as "one or more", so this is what a peer sent and not what this client will produce |

## 4. The two credit schemes

Both are implemented, both are checked before every frame, and they are two types rather than
one because the specification ties them together nowhere (sheet §5.3).

| Scheme | Unit | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Link credit (Part 2 §2.6.7) | **messages** | present — `credit.rs`. All four variables; the absolute delivery-limit arithmetic in RFC 1982 serial numbers, so a duplicated or reordered `flow` cannot inflate credit; `drain` consuming all remaining credit and reporting; zero is a stall and not an error |
| Session window (Part 2 §2.5.6) | **`transfer` frames** | present — `window.rs`. All six variables including **both** branches of the `remote-incoming-window` recomputation, the one that decides whether a session can send its first frame at all; a peer exceeding our window is answered with `end` carrying `amqp:session:window-violation` |
| Both together | — | present, and asserted as such: `the_session_window_stalls_a_sender_that_still_has_link_credit` gives a sender four units of link credit and a one-frame window and watches it send one frame, and a 1600-octet message through a 512-octet frame costs **one** unit of credit and four window units |
| Per-connection credit | — | absent, and absent from the protocol: "there is no per-connection credit" (sheet §5). Nothing is missing here; the row exists so that a reader looking for it stops looking |

## 5. Settle modes and delivery states

What each mode *proves to an application* is the subject of `settlement.rs`'s own table and of
`tests/disposition.rs`, where every test asserts a conclusion — the message will not come back,
the message is available again, the peer knows that this end knows — rather than that a frame
arrived.

| Mode | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `snd-settle-mode=unsettled` | present — the sender keeps the delivery until the receiver's `disposition` retires it |
| `snd-settle-mode=settled` | present — settled on send, recorded nowhere, and `Link::settled` refuses with a message saying so, because an application that could wait for that answer would wait forever |
| `snd-settle-mode=mixed` | present — the per-delivery choice, and this client's choice for a `mixed` link is *unsettled*, because a settled transfer is one the receiver cannot report anything about |
| `rcv-settle-mode=first` | present — the receiver settles as it reports: one frame, done |
| `rcv-settle-mode=second` | present — the three-frame dance, driven by the **driver** rather than the application: when the receiver publishes an outcome without settling, the sender owes a settling `disposition` and nothing is left to decide. Measured against `fe2o3-amqp` 0.17.0, which **honours** it with `SupportedReceiverSettleModes::Both` — so the sheet's §13 "implementations refuse it" is not universal. RabbitMQ: not run; its documentation lists exactly-once unsupported (sheet source [16]), which is a claim and not a measurement |

| Delivery state | Descriptor | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accepted` | `0x24` | present — and `Outcome::may_be_redelivered` is false, `increments_delivery_count` false |
| `rejected` | `0x25` | present — with the peer's error carried through; not redelivered, and it **does** increment `delivery-count` |
| `released` | `0x26` | present — available again, `delivery-count` **not** incremented, so indistinguishable from a message never delivered |
| `modified` | `0x27` | present — `delivery-failed` and `undeliverable-here` as `Option<bool>` because the specification gives them no defaults, and the annotations map carried |
| `received` | `0x23` | present in the codec and **deliberately not an `Outcome`**: it is the one non-terminal state, it describes how far a partial body got, and an application that treated it as an answer would be acting on a progress report. A `disposition` carrying it is recorded as progress |

The **unsettled map** is present at each end (`settlement.rs`), with settlement idempotent and
one-way: a `disposition` naming a delivery this end has forgotten is nothing, which is what
makes the frame safe to repeat and why a lost one needs no recovery protocol.

## 6. SASL and TLS

| Mechanism | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `ANONYMOUS` | present — `sasl.rs`; what a server not requiring authentication SHOULD advertise |
| `PLAIN` | present — the whole exchange is one NUL-separated initial response |
| `EXTERNAL` | present — the identity comes from the layer below, in practice a TLS client certificate; RabbitMQ reaches x.509 authentication through it |
| No SASL layer at all | present — `AMQP %d0 1.0.0` and `open` immediately, which is legal and is the default |
| `CRAM-MD5`, `DIGEST-MD5`, `SCRAM-SHA-*`, `GSSAPI`, `NTLM` | **absent** — what is missing: the mechanisms and the cryptographic stacks under them. Part 5 delegates the registry to IANA and requires none of these; a mechanism this client cannot speak is **not offered**, and a server that offers only these is refused at the `sasl-mechanisms` step with the list it sent, rather than downgraded |
| Mechanism negotiation | **refused with a reason** — the mechanism is *chosen* by configuration and not negotiated. A server that does not offer the chosen one fails with a message naming what it did offer, because silently picking another is how a client ends up authenticating in a way its operator did not ask for |

| Transport | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| TCP, port 5672 | present — `transport.rs`. The only mapping Part 2 §2.8.19 defines |
| TLS as a layer, protocol-id `%d2` | present — `AMQP %d2 1.0.0` exchanged, TLS negotiated, then `AMQP %d0 1.0.0` *inside* it: two header exchanges, the second encrypted |
| TLS out of band, `amqps` on 5671 | present — a pure TLS listener with no protocol header before the handshake, which is the documented alternative to `%d2` and what `amqps` means |
| The trust anchors | **deliberately not in the crate** — `Connection::connect_tls` takes the caller's `rustls::ClientConfig`, because which certificates an application trusts is the application's decision and a library that chooses cannot be audited |
| UDP, SCTP | **absent, and absent from the protocol**: Part 2 §2.8.19 reserves the port numbers and defines **no mapping**. Nothing is missing that a specification supplies |
| WebSocket (`AMQP-WSB-01`) | **absent** — what is missing: the binding itself, its subprotocol negotiation and the framing over it. It is a separate OASIS committee specification and not part of the core five parts this library is measured against |

## 7. What is absent, with the evidence

Three families, each named absent here rather than claimed in part.

### 7.1 Part 4: transactions

**Absent, by construction.** Part 4's transactional target is a `coordinator` — a *different
described type* from `target` — and this client's `LinkOptions::target` is typed as a
[`Target`], so there is no value of this API that attaches to a coordinator. What is missing:
the `coordinator` target, the `declare` and `discharge` messages, `txn-id` on `transfer`,
`disposition` and `flow`, the `transactional-state` delivery state, and the `amqp:txn:local`,
`amqp:txn:multi-txns-per-ssn`, `amqp:txn:multi-ssns-per-txn` and `amqp:txn:distributed-txns`
capabilities.

The evidence that this is the honest verdict and not a gap in the measurement: **Part 6,
Distributed Transactions, was never published** (sheet §6.5), so `amqp:txn:distributed-txns`
names a capability no specification defines. `fe2o3-amqp` gates its own transaction support
behind a non-default `transaction` feature, and the interop probe confirms neither end claims
an `amqp:txn:` capability. The codec does carry the five delivery-state descriptors of Part 3
§3.4 and not Part 4's sixth, which is the same boundary drawn in the other crate.

### 7.2 Link resumption

**Absent.** What is missing: `attach.unsettled` populated on the way out,
`incomplete-unsettled`, the `resume` flag on `transfer`, and the three-way rule that decides
which tags may be resumed (sheet §12: tags only the sender holds MAY be resumed, tags only the
receiver holds MUST be ignored, tags both hold MUST be resumed).

What *is* present is the half that makes the absence safe rather than silent: this client's
second `attach` of a name carries **no `unsettled` map at all**, which is exactly what
distinguishes a re-attach from a resuming attach (Part 2 §2.6.13), so a peer is never told that
state is being recovered when it is not. The delivery-**tag** is kept in the unsettled map
beside the delivery-id precisely because the tag is what a resumption would key on, so the data
a later implementation needs is already there. Measured: `fe2o3-amqp` 0.17.0 accepts a
re-attach of a name it has let go as a new link, and **refuses** a second attach of a name it
still holds rather than implementing Part 2 §2.6.1's steal — so a client cannot rely on the
steal against that peer.

### 7.3 The three coexisting filter families

**The `filter` field is present; no filter family is interpreted.** `Source::filter` carries a
filter-set — a symbol-keyed map of described types — through the `attach` in both directions
and reports what the peer echoed, so an application may set a filter its broker understands
and read the answer. What is missing is any *understanding* of the three families, which is the
part that cannot be written once:

1. **Apache Qpid's `apache.org:selector-filter:string` and `apache.org:no-local-filter:list`**
   (descriptors `0x0000468C:0x00000004` and `:0x00000003`), described as *proposed* AMQP 1.0
   filters and not a standard registry (sheet §13 source [33]).
2. **AMQP Filter Expressions CSD 01**, an entirely different family with codes in the
   `0x100`-`0x178` range and its own capability names (`APACHE.ORG:SELECTOR`,
   `APACHE.ORG:NO_LOCAL`) — a committee specification draft, not one of the five parts.
3. **Vendor filters**: `rabbitmq:stream-filter`, `rabbitmq:stream-match-unfiltered`,
   `com.microsoft:session-filter` and the rest, which are neither of the above.

A client MUST negotiate rather than assume (sheet §13), and negotiation over three
incompatible families with overlapping intent is a per-broker decision an application makes,
not a library default. So the field is carried and nothing is invented.

## 8. Bounds

Every remote-influenced allocation has a named bound. Where the protocol supplies one this
library uses **the protocol's**, and where it does not, the bound is ours and says so
([INVARIANTS.md](../INVARIANTS.md)).

| Bound | Default | Whose, and what it bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channel-max` | 255 advertised | the protocol's. The session table is bounded by the **peer's** value, because that is the number saying which channels the peer will accept |
| `handle-max` | 255 advertised | the protocol's. The link table per session, again the peer's value |
| `incoming-window` | 400 | the protocol's, and one of only three bounds in AMQP that are safe by construction: `begin.incoming-window` is mandatory and has no default. 400 is the number RabbitMQ 4.x uses |
| `link-credit` | 0 initially | the protocol's. A freshly attached link carries no permission to send anything at all |
| `max-message-size` | **16 MiB** | the protocol's field, **our default**. The specification's default is no limit, which is agreeing to allocate whatever a peer sends one bounded frame at a time; nothing bounds the *number* of frames a delivery may take. Settable back to zero, never silently |
| `max-frame-size` | **128 KiB** | the protocol's field, **our default**. The specification's default is `4294967295` — a four-gigabyte frame on a peer's word |
| `idle-time-out` | **60 s** | the protocol's field, **our default**. The specification's default is unset, which is a connection that holds its resources until the OS notices |
| `connection::OUTGOING_QUEUE` | 64 | ours. The protocol has no queue here at all |
| `session::SESSION_QUEUE` | 64 | ours. Frames for a session that name no link — the specification leaves them outside every window |
| `link::LINK_QUEUE` | 64 | ours. `attach`, `detach` and `disposition` are outside both credit schemes and the specification bounds them nowhere |
| `settlement::DEFAULT_MAX_UNSETTLED` | 2048 | ours, and **only on the sender's side**: a receiver's unsettled map cannot grow except against credit it granted itself, so the protocol already bounds it, while a receiver that keeps granting credit and settles nothing would grow a sender's map without limit. At the bound `send` waits |
| `sasl::MAX_ROUNDS` | 16 | ours. Part 5 §5.3's challenge/response loop is "zero or more" rounds |
| `ConnectionOptions::max_resolved_addresses` | 8 | ours. What a name may expand to |

## 9. Interop

`crates/amqp/weida-amqp/tests/interop_fe2o3.rs` — **8 tests, nothing ignored**, against
`fe2o3-amqp` 0.17.0's `acceptor` over loopback. Both roles: our sender read by its receiver,
our receiver reading its sender, and an 8 KiB message through a 1 KiB frame reassembled whole
at the peer. Four probes rather than assumptions, each recorded above: `rcv-settle-mode=second`
(§5), terminus expiry policy (echoed, not substituted), duplicate link name (refused, not
stolen — §7.2), and transactions (§7.1). `cargo tree -p weida-amqp --no-dev-dependencies`
reaches neither `weida` nor `weida-protocol`, and the peer brings no second TLS stack.

`crates/amqp/weida-amqp/tests/interop_rabbitmq.rs` — **4 tests, all `#[ignore]`d**, because
`which rabbitmq-server` is empty. The harness starts and stops the broker on a port of its own
and waits for the socket rather than assuming readiness; every test says what it *would*
establish. **Nothing in it has been observed**, and the sheet's RabbitMQ claims stay
documentation until it runs.

## 10. Three bugs interop found, and what they were

Recorded because each was a rule misread, and the misreadings are the kind a reader of this
library would repeat.

1. **`close` was overtaking a completed transfer.** "`close` MUST be the last frame ever
   written" (Part 2 §2.4.3) makes it *last*; it is not a licence to drop what was already
   queued. The driver's biased `select` preferred the command channel over the outbound queue,
   so a frame a sender had already handed over was dropped as "raced the close". Fixed by
   flushing the queue before writing `close`.
2. **A `flow` for a just-detached handle ended the session.** That frame is a race with the
   `detach`, not a fault, and `fe2o3-amqp` really sends one. Frames for the peer's handles of
   **cleanly** detached links are now discarded; a handle detached **with an error** now gets
   `amqp:session:errant-link`, which Part 2 §2.6.5 names and which was not being distinguished
   from `amqp:session:unattached-handle` at all.
3. **A client that re-attached a name stole its own just-detached link**, sending
   `amqp:link:stolen` for a link the application had closed itself and poisoning the handle for
   the rest of the session. Links already detaching are no longer candidates for the steal.

A fourth, found by the same run: the peer's `detach` was **not being answered**. A link
endpoint is destroyed only when both ends have detached, so a peer whose application held the
link waited forever.

## 11. The definition of done

0013 §4.7's six clauses, read for AMQP, each with its verdict and where this document proves
it.

| Clause | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Every performative of Part 2 §2.7 implemented or absent with a reason, with the specification's own field layouts asserted rather than described | **met** — §2: all nine present, with `tests/golden_performatives.rs` asserting the figures |
| 2. The transports the specification defines, with the rest named absent | **met** — §6: TCP and both routes to TLS present; UDP and SCTP are reserved with no mapping *in the specification*; the WebSocket binding is absent with what is missing named |
| 3. The security layers: SASL with the mechanisms a client can speak, and TLS | **met** — §6: `ANONYMOUS`, `PLAIN`, `EXTERNAL` and no-SASL present; the rest absent with the reason, and never offered |
| 4. Interop in both roles against a foreign implementation | **met** — §9: 8 tests against `fe2o3-amqp` 0.17.0, both roles, four probed facts. RabbitMQ 4.x is `#[ignore]`d and stated as not run |
| 5. The message model: every section, both credit schemes, the settle modes and the delivery states | **met** — §3, §4, §5 |
| 6. A feature-parity table, row by row, where no row says "partial" without saying what is missing | **met** — this document |

What a caller who compares this library with the OASIS core does **not** get, in one list: Part
4 transactions and the `coordinator` target; link resumption; any *interpretation* of the three
filter families, though the field is carried; SASL beyond `ANONYMOUS`, `PLAIN` and `EXTERNAL`;
the WebSocket binding; and a broker — no node model, because the standard defines none.
Nothing else.
