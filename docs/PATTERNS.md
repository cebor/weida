# Patterns

The reference for what each weida pattern does, in the shape of `zmq_socket(3)`: one table
per pattern naming its compatible peer, direction, routing strategy and behaviour when it has
nowhere to send, followed by what happens at every failure. Where ZeroMQ's tables describe
what its threads and queues do, these describe what the **transport** does, because a weida
pattern is a thin wrapper over transport streams and inherits its behaviour from them.

Four transports carry those streams today ([decisions/0010](decisions/0010-local-transport.md),
[0012](decisions/0012-local-connection-grouping.md)): QUIC, an in-process channel pair,
`AF_UNIX` and, on Windows, a named pipe, where the OS connection **is** the stream. Every statement below is written for
QUIC unless it says otherwise, because QUIC is the transport whose flow control the patterns
were designed against; §1.10 says which of them mean something different locally, and the
failure tables name the transport where the two diverge.

Every statement below that could be false is defended by a test named in the text. The
measured numbers are from `crates/weida/tests/streams.rs` on loopback with `quinn 0.11`; the
statements hold on any link, the numbers do not. `crates/weida/tests/transports.rs` runs one
body per pattern — Req/Rep, Push/Pull, Pub/Sub, PAIR, SURVEY and BUS — over every one of
those transports, which is what makes the pattern semantics a fact about weida rather than
about QUIC. PAIR earns its place there twice over: its **bound** side is the only one that
opens a stream toward a peer that dialled it, so it is the pattern that proves the reverse
pool of [0012](decisions/0012-local-connection-grouping.md) §4.4 carries an ordinary send.

## 1. Common ground: what a stream is

Every user data flow is one stream: one QUIC stream over the network, one channel pair in
process, one `AF_UNIX` connection locally — "the OS connection **is** the stream" [0010 §4.2].
A Push message, a published copy, the request half of an exchange and its reply half are each
a stream of their own. What follows is true of all of them, whichever pattern opened them and
whichever transport carries them, except where §1.10 says a local transport differs.

### 1.1 `finish()` is a commitment

Once `OutgoingTransfer::finish` has queued the FIN, the payload arrives without any local
handle. The transfer is consumed, the `Delivery` may be dropped, the endpoint may go out of
scope; only the connection has to live, and the runtime's pool holds it.
`Runtime::shutdown` is the one thing that cuts a finished transfer short. Its counterpart is
`Runtime::drain(deadline)`: it stops admitting work, gives the transfers that were already
finished until the deadline to reach the peer's **transport**, and only then performs the
same close ([decisions/0009](decisions/0009-drain.md) §4.1-§4.6). What comes back is a pair
of counts, `Drained { delivered, outstanding }`, not a promise — and an expired drain with
something still outstanding is not an error. The deadline is mandatory and finite: there is
no infinite variant to set by accident [0009 §4.3].

*`a_finished_transfer_needs_no_local_handle_to_arrive`,
`a_finished_transfer_that_shutdown_cuts_short_arrives_under_drain`.*

### 1.2 The receipt, inside and beyond the window

`Delivery::delivered()` resolves when the peer's **transport** holds every byte and the FIN.
Inside the peer's stream receive window that is all it means: the receipt resolves before the
peer's application has called `recv`, and even while the transfer is still parked in the
peer's accept queue.

Beyond the window it means more, because QUIC cannot accept more bytes than the window until
the application has consumed some. For a payload of `p` bytes against a window of `w`, the
receipt cannot resolve until the reader has consumed at least `p - w` bytes, rounded up to the
next eighth of a window (quinn announces window credit in eighths). So a receipt for a large
transfer is evidence that the application is reading it; a receipt for a small one is not.

**And it stays an explanation rather than an interface.** There is deliberately no byte-cursor on
`Delivery`: QUIC tracks the acknowledged ranges and `quinn` keeps them internal, ZeroMQ hides even
the connect and offers a separate opt-in monitor socket instead, and an API here would invite an
application to rebuild the reliability QUIC already provides — the mistake
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §1 records for brokerless application ACKs. What *is*
cursor-shaped is a store's durability and a consumer's settlement, which are application state and
travel as frames ([decisions/0023](decisions/0023-completion-is-a-cursor.md)).

*`push_delivery_receipt` (1 KiB, resolves before `recv`);
`a_receipt_beyond_the_window_implies_the_reader_consumed` (160 KiB against a 64 KiB window:
the write completed once 131072 bytes were consumed, the receipt at 163840);
`the_stream_budget_is_backpressure_not_an_error` (receipt resolves for a transfer still in
the accept queue).*

### 1.3 Two windows, one shared

Flow control is per stream and per connection, and the two behave differently:

- **Per stream, transfers are isolated.** A stream nobody reads does not delay its siblings.
- **Per connection, one slow reader stalls every other writer on that connection** — and
  "that connection" is now one **endpoint path**. The connection window is shared by every
  stream on the connection. Unread streams consume it; when it is spent, every writer on the
  connection blocks until the slow reader consumes at least an eighth of the window. Since
  one connection per dialled path
  ([decisions/0002](decisions/0002-control-and-bulk-separation.md) §6.2), "everyone" means
  the writers on that path and nothing else: another path is another connection and another
  window. What is *not* isolated is a path's own control traffic: a SUBSCRIBE rides the
  connection of the path it names, because that is the only route back to the subscriber
  ([decisions/0011](decisions/0011-answered-where-it-arrived.md) §4.1-§4.2), so an endpoint
  that publishes *and* subscribes on one path can queue its own subscription behind its own
  payload. A pure subscriber writes nothing there and a pure publisher sends no SUBSCRIBE,
  so neither is affected [0011 §4.4].
- **The header spends the window too.** The DATA header rides on the transfer's own stream, so
  the payload that fits in one window is `stream_receive_window - header`, and the last eighth
  only clears once the application reads. A payload sized exactly to the window therefore
  blocks until the reader starts. `stream_receive_window` is a buffer size, not a message size.

*`a_stalled_stream_does_not_block_its_siblings` (64 KiB stream window, 256 KiB connection
window, 32 KiB per stream: siblings flow past an unread stream; the seventh unread stream
stalls the connection at 229376 bytes; reading the first one releases it);
`a_stalled_path_does_not_stall_another_path` (the same numbers on two paths: one path's window
is filled until a write parks, and a send on the other path arrives anyway);
`a_payload_the_size_of_the_stream_window_waits_for_the_reader`.*

### 1.4 The stream budget is backpressure, and it lands on `open`

A peer grants `max_concurrent_uni_streams` and `max_concurrent_bidi_streams`. A transfer holds
its stream until it has been read to EOF, dropped or refused — including while it sits in a
bounded accept queue. When the budget is spent, the next `open` waits. It does not fail, and
`write_all` and `finish` are never reached. A deeper `endpoint_queue` changes nothing: a queued
transfer still owns its stream.

*`the_stream_budget_is_backpressure_not_an_error`,
`a_deeper_endpoint_queue_does_not_raise_the_stream_budget`,
`a_replier_that_stops_accepting_stalls_requesters_after_the_queue_fills` (bidi budget 2,
queue 1: exactly two exchanges complete, the third waits in `open`, one `accept` releases it).*

**The stream budget *is* weida's message credit at L0.** There is no application credit, at
L0 or on the wire: QUIC's byte windows are the byte credit and the concurrent-stream budget is
the message credit, both receiver-granted through transport parameters and both absolute and
idempotent ([decisions/0003](decisions/0003-credit-unit.md) §4.1). A consumer that wants a
prefetch of *n* messages grants `max_concurrent_uni_streams = n` on the connection it reads
from — one per dialled path, per §1.3 — and that is the whole mechanism
[0003 §5]. A per-subscription message credit arrives with the L2 broker and travels on the
connection of the path its subscription names, never at L0 [0003 §4.2, as amended by
[0011](decisions/0011-answered-where-it-arrived.md) §4.3].

### 1.5 Cancel: never EOF, not a retraction

`OutgoingTransfer::cancel` (and dropping an unfinished transfer) resets the stream. The reader
never observes the transfer as complete: `AsyncRead` fails with `io::ErrorKind::ConnectionReset`,
`read_capped`/`collect` with `Error::Canceled`, never `Ok(0)`. Bytes the reader already took
are unaffected. Bytes already buffered at the receiver may still be read before the reset is
processed: cancellation guarantees the peer cannot mistake the transfer for a whole one, not
that the peer saw fewer bytes.

*`cancel_discards_unread_bytes_and_keeps_read_ones`, `push_cancel_mid_transfer`,
`cancel_mid_transfer`.*

### 1.6 Refusal of a one-way transfer can lose the race to the receipt

A peer refuses a one-way transfer with `STOP_SENDING` and a code (`UNKNOWN_ENDPOINT`,
`UNSUPPORTED`, `REJECTED`). That is an application act, and it races the transport
acknowledgement: a payload that fits in flight can be acknowledged by the peer's transport
before its application refuses it, and `delivered()` then resolves `Ok` — truthfully, since a
receipt says nothing about the application, including that it said no. **This is a decided
position, not an open question** ([decisions/0005](decisions/0005-refusal-race.md)): no
application-level signal is added to the L0 wire to order a refusal ahead of the receipt, and
the deterministic counterpart is the reserved `Accepted` of an L2 broker hop. A refusal is
guaranteed to be observed in exactly two constructions [0005 §4.3]: a payload beyond the peer's
stream receive window, where flow control forces the application to act before the write can
finish, and an exchange, whose ERROR frame is written by the application on the reply half and
takes precedence over the request half's receipt. Once the receipt has resolved, a later
refusal reaches **no observer at all** — the `Delivery` is consumed, and no counter, metric or
late error is added for it [0005 §4.4].

*`push_to_an_unknown_path_is_reported`, `push_to_rep_path_is_unsupported`,
`a_publisher_path_refuses_inbound_transfers` (all with 2 MiB payloads for this reason);
`unknown_endpoint_is_reported`, `request_to_pull_path_is_unsupported` (Req/Rep).*

### 1.7 Ordering is per stream and nothing else

Bytes within a stream arrive in order. Streams arrive in no particular order relative to each
other: a peer that opens A then B may see B dispatched first. Every pattern's ordering is
therefore `None` across messages ([GUARANTEES.md](GUARANTEES.md) §6), and the within-stream
order is the only order there is. An application that needs message order must carry it in
the payload or keep one long-lived stream (§5). The sequence key of
[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) §6.2 will let a receiver *detect* a gap or reassemble in order, and
the cost of reassembling is measured: reverse-order completion forces a reorder buffer of
N − 1 of the transfers in flight, and 84 of 256 were held with no adversarial pattern at all
([IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) §4, B-010). Ordering is not free at the receiver, which
is why it is negotiated rather than default ([GUARANTEES.md](GUARANTEES.md) §3).

### 1.8 Liveness: idle timeout, keep-alive, no reconnect

- A connection with no traffic is declared dead after `RuntimeConfig::idle_timeout` (30 s
  default), the smaller of the two peers' values governing both.
- Only the **dialling** side sends keep-alives (`RuntimeConfig::keep_alive`, 10 s default). A
  binding with an idle timeout shorter than its clients' keep-alive interval drops them.
- Loss surfaces as `Error::ConnectionLost(cause)` from the next operation, and the cause is
  kept rather than flattened: `IdleTimeout`, `PeerClosed`, `LocallyClosed`, `Reset` or
  `TransportError`. It is not a second outcome — the failure is definite whichever it is —
  but it is what tells an application whether redialling makes sense. `Peer::peer_count`
  stops counting the dead peer.
- **Nothing reconnects.** The application calls `connect` again, with the same or a new
  address; the dead entry is reaped then. A `Subscriber` re-sends its filters on `connect`.

*`idle_timeout_reports_loss_within_the_window` (server idle timeout 500 ms, client
keep-alive 10 s, `ConnectionLost(IdleTimeout)` after 1.5 s of silence);
`after_the_server_restarts_the_pusher_must_reconnect`.*

### 1.9 Identity: who is on the other side

A peer is named by the SHA-256 fingerprint of its public key (`Fingerprint`, text form
`sha256:<64 hex>`). The dialling side states whom it accepts with `Trust` — pins, anchors, or
only what the address names (`weida://sha256:…@host:port/path`) — and a binding may require a
client identity with `ServerTls::require_client`. Whatever arrives on a stream carries the
peer's identity in `IncomingMeta::peer`: `PeerIdentity::Key(fingerprint)` over QUIC, `None`
for an anonymous client, `PeerIdentity::Local { uid, gid, pid }` over `AF_UNIX` and
`PeerIdentity::Windows { sid, pid }` over a named pipe, where the **kernel** is the prover
instead of TLS and a PID is an observation that must not be authorized on [0010 §4.4]. In
process there is no identity at all, because there is no boundary to prove anything across.
Whichever it is, it comes from the transport and never from a header, so it can be authorized
on but not forged. A peer outside the terms fails `connect` with
`Error::Untrusted(fingerprint)`, carrying what answered so an operator can pin it after
checking it out of band.

**Authorizing on it is the application's, and the shape is decided**
([decisions/0015](decisions/0015-peer-authorization.md)): the handshake carries no
application credential and will not grow one, so a handler authorizes on `meta().peer`
together with the path the stream dispatched to, and refuses with `Rejected` — or, to keep
the path invisible, by not registering it. A **token** flow, where the grant comes from a
third party rather than from the key, needs two things and they are both existing pieces: a
companion Req/Rep path the client posts the token to, and `ServerTls::require_client`, so
that the verdict can be held against a proved fingerprint. Without client identity a verdict
lives no longer than the connection it was given on, and a *subscription* cannot present a
token at all, because SUBSCRIBE has no reply half ([PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) §6.4) — the one
cost that answer has, named here rather than discovered.

*`crates/weida/tests/identity.rs`, all ten.*

### 1.10 What a local transport changes

Everything above is written against QUIC. Over the two local transports of
[0010](decisions/0010-local-transport.md) five of those statements mean something else, and
the difference is always the same cause: there is no QUIC connection to share, because one
transfer is one channel pair (inproc) or one OS connection (`AF_UNIX`).

- **§1.2's window arithmetic does not apply.** A receipt still means the peer's transport
  holds the bytes, but "beyond the window" has no local analogue: inproc hands over a buffer
  and a socket has the kernel's own buffer, so a receipt is never evidence that the
  application is reading. The weaker reading — a transport receipt is not an application
  read — is the one that holds everywhere.
- **§1.3's two windows collapse into one.** There is no connection window to share, so the
  head-of-line coupling the per-path connections of
  [0002](decisions/0002-control-and-bulk-separation.md) exist to remove cannot arise:
  `a_stalled_path_does_not_stall_another_path` is a statement about QUIC, and locally it is
  true by construction. What replaces it is a descriptor count — every live transfer is a
  file descriptor, bounded by `max_local_streams` (255, the number Windows' pipe instance cap
  fixes) rather than by a stream budget.
- **§1.4's stream budget becomes that descriptor count.** `open` waits for a descriptor at
  the local ceiling exactly as it waits for a QUIC stream at the peer's budget: the
  backpressure is a wait on every transport, bounded by the caller's own deadline and
  cancelled by dropping the future (B-059). A descriptor comes free when a transfer ends,
  which locally means when both ends are done with it — so a consumer that stops reading
  slows its producer down instead of failing it. What `LimitExceeded` still means locally is
  a refusal somebody decided on, the reverse pool of §4 below, and never a busy transport.
- **§1.8's liveness is the kernel's.** There is no idle timeout and no keep-alive locally: a
  peer that goes away closes its socket or drops its channel, which arrives as
  `ConnectionLost(PeerClosed)` on the next operation. That is a *better* signal than a timer,
  and it is why the two timers are not simulated — an invented local heartbeat would only be
  able to say what the kernel already said.
- **§4's fan-out needs a parked connection.** A publisher on a socket transport writes each
  copy on a reverse connection the subscriber parked in advance
  ([0012](decisions/0012-local-connection-grouping.md) §4.4), bounded by
  `Limits::max_parked_reverse` (8). An exhausted pool is a **second drop cause** beside the
  subscriber byte budget of §4: the copy is dropped, counted in `Publisher::dropped`, and the
  subscription survives. A subscriber that parks nothing is refused at `connect` rather than
  silently receiving nothing.

### 1.11 An interrupted stream: cancel, reschedule, reconnect — never a resend

A message can be batched and retried because it is complete before it is sent. A **stream is
unfinished by definition** until its FIN, so the interesting failure is not "was it delivered"
but "what does a half-sent stream mean". weida answers that in one sentence and then hands the
decision over:

> **Within a connection, QUIC retransmits; when the connection ends, an unfinished stream is
> gone, and weida does not resend it.**

What the two sides observe is already exact. The sender gets `ConnectionLost` before FIN and `Ok`
after it (§1.1, the pattern tables below); the receiver never sees an unfinished stream as
complete — `AsyncRead` fails with `ConnectionReset`, `collect` with `Error::Canceled`, **never**
`Ok(0)` (§1.5). "Half a frame is not a frame" (§4.1) is the rule, not a special case.

What happens next is the **application's** choice, and there are exactly three, one of which is
usually wrong:

| Answer | When it is right | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **cancel** — the transfer is abandoned | the payload was only useful whole and only useful now: a video frame, a live tail, a snapshot that is already stale | nothing; this is the default, because it is what the transport already did |
| **reschedule** — the work is re-derived and sent as a *new* stream | the sender still holds or can regenerate the source, and the receiver is idempotent or does not care | the sender keeps the source, or can produce it again |
| **reconnect and continue** — a new stream carries the remainder | the payload is large, immutable and expensive to re-send, and the receiver reported **how far it got** | an application-level identity for "the same payload", plus a receiver that persisted a prefix. Both are the application's; weida supplies neither |

The third is the one that needs the cursors of
[decisions/0023](decisions/0023-completion-is-a-cursor.md): a receiver that reports "durable up to
*N*" is telling the sender what it may skip, and the sender decides. weida does **not** decide,
does not remember a payload, and does not re-open a stream on anyone's behalf — a library that
did would be rebuilding retries, which are Phase 4 and, in every system this repository surveyed,
application-level (ZeroMQ's Lazy Pirate and Titanic are recipes, not features).

Which answer a pattern needs follows from the pattern, not from the transport:

| Pattern | The usual answer | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Req/Rep | **reschedule** | a request has a reply half, so the requester learns the outcome and can re-issue; `Indeterminate` is exactly the case where re-issuing must be safe ([FAILURE_MODEL.md](FAILURE_MODEL.md)) |
| Push/Pull | **reschedule**, and only the sender can | the puller cannot ask: a one-way transfer has no reply half. This is the trade the pattern is |
| Pub/Sub | **cancel** | the copy is per subscriber and best effort by definition; a dropped copy is counted, not retried ([GUARANTEES.md](GUARANTEES.md) §6) |
| PAIR | **reschedule** | symmetric, so either side can re-send what it still holds; neither has a reply half to ask with, exactly as Push/Pull |
| SURVEY | **cancel** | a survey is a partial result by construction: an answer that did not arrive before the deadline is dropped and counted, and re-asking is a new survey |
| BUS | **cancel** | a copy is per member and best effort, as Pub/Sub's is; a member that could not take one is counted in `dropped()` |
| a queue (L2) | **cancel on the way in, reschedule on the way out** | an inbound stream that never reached FIN was never a message, so nothing was admitted and nothing was confirmed; a delivery that broke is redelivered, because the queue still holds the message |

That last row is the whole bridge from the stream primitives to the message world: **a message is
a stream that reached FIN.** Which is why the stream and message pattern families **overlap rather
than stack**: Req/Rep is both, because a request is a stream and a completed request is a message,
and the message vocabulary adds an assumption — the payload is whole before it is used — rather
than a layer ([decisions/0024](decisions/0024-three-families-one-back-channel.md) §4.1). A queue's unit is a completed stream, which is why an interrupted
admission needs no vocabulary of its own — there is nothing to talk about yet — and why a
redelivery is an ordinary new stream rather than a continuation.

**Every row of both tables above is a test** (B-242,
`crates/weida/tests/interrupted.rs`), and so is the rule they follow from: a transfer
interrupted before FIN is a definite `ConnectionLost` for the sender
(*`a_transfer_interrupted_before_fin_is_connection_lost_for_the_sender`*); a reader never sees
an interrupted stream as complete, with `collect` failing `Canceled`, `AsyncRead` failing
`ConnectionReset` and **never** `Ok(0)`
(*`a_reader_never_sees_an_interrupted_stream_as_complete`*); a requester learns
`Indeterminate` and can re-issue (*`a_reqrep_requester_can_reissue_after_an_indeterminate_outcome`*);
a Push producer is the only side that can (*`a_push_producer_is_the_only_side_that_can_reschedule`*);
a lost fan-out copy is counted and never re-sent
(*`a_pubsub_copy_lost_to_a_dead_subscriber_is_counted_not_retried`*); and a cursor reported
before the break **survives** it
(*`a_cursor_reported_before_the_break_survives_the_break`*) — which is the whole value of a
cursor over a verdict: a whole-message verdict tells an interrupted sender nothing, a cursor
tells it a number. Beside them sits the liveness bound a reliable work chain depends on:
a bound side observes a dead dialler within `Limits::idle_timeout`
(*`a_bound_side_observes_a_dead_dialler_within_the_idle_timeout`*).

---

## 2. Req/Rep

One bidirectional stream per exchange. The requester writes the request on its half and reads
the reply, or an ERROR, on the other. The stream is the correlation; nothing on the wire names
an exchange.

| | `Requester` (`Req`) | `Replier` (`Rep`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compatible peer | `Replier`, `Acceptor` | `Requester`, `Peer::open_bi` |
| Direction | connects | binds |
| Send/receive pattern | any number of concurrent exchanges, each `open` → write → `finish` → `recv` | `accept` → read body → `reply` → write → `finish`, or `refuse(code)`, or drop for `NO_REPLY` |
| Incoming routing | the reply half of the exchange that asked | fair, bounded queue per path (`endpoint_queue`) |
| Outgoing routing | round-robin over live peers, one exchange per pick | the exchange that asked |
| Action with no peer | `Error::NotConnected` immediately; `ConnectionLost` if every peer died | `accept` waits |
| Transport | one client-opened bidirectional stream | |
| Ordering | `None` across exchanges; request and reply each in order | |
| Delivery signal | the reply itself; the request's receipt is available from `open` but proves less than the reply | |
| Backpressure | `max_concurrent_bidi_streams` on `open`, then both halves' windows | a full queue stalls the requester's `open` |
| Cancellation | drop the `ReplyStream`: `STOP_SENDING(CANCELED)` on the reply half, `IncomingRequest::canceled` fires | drop the request: ERROR `NO_REPLY` + `STOP_SENDING(REJECTED)` |

Failure modes, from the requester's side:

| Event | Result of `recv` / `request` |
| --- | --- |
| Path unknown at the peer | `Error::UnknownEndpoint` (ERROR frame) |
| Path serves another pattern | `Error::Unsupported` (ERROR frame) |
| Replier dropped the request | `Error::NoReply`; the request may have had an effect |
| Replier refused on purpose | the code it chose: `Error::Rejected`, or `Error::NoReply` where the request was taken and nobody will answer it — an adapter whose far side dropped it silently |
| Connection lost before the request FIN | `Error::ConnectionLost` from the write: definitely not delivered |
| Connection lost after the FIN, no reply seen | `Error::Indeterminate`: the replier may have acted |
| Replier reset the reply mid-stream | `Error::Canceled` from the read |

Request and reply stream simultaneously: the replier may `take_body` and `reply` before the
request has finished, and a requester writing a large request must drain the reply
concurrently or it stalls the replier and therefore itself
(*`streaming_overlap`*). Router/Dealer are not separate types: unlimited concurrent exchanges
give Dealer's multiplexing, and the reply riding the originating stream gives Router's
addressing for free ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §6a).

---

## 3. Push/Pull

One unidirectional stream per message. Fire-and-forget with an optional transport receipt.

| | `Pusher` (`Push`) | `Puller` (`Pull`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compatible peer | `Puller`, `Acceptor` | `Pusher`, `Peer::open` |
| Direction | connects | binds |
| Send/receive pattern | `send` (returns at FIN, receipt dropped) or `open` → write → `finish` → `delivered` | `recv` → read |
| Incoming routing | — | fair, bounded queue per path (`endpoint_queue`) |
| Outgoing routing | round-robin over live peers, one message per pick | — |
| Action with no peer | `Error::NotConnected` immediately; `ConnectionLost` if every peer died — never blocks, unlike ZeroMQ's PUSH | `recv` waits |
| Transport | one client-opened unidirectional stream | |
| Ordering | `None` | |
| Delivery signal | none (`send`) or the transport receipt (§1.2) | none; EOF is EOF |
| Backpressure | `max_concurrent_uni_streams` on `open` (§1.4), then the windows (§1.3) | a puller that stops reading stalls its pushers after the budget; nothing is dropped |
| Cancellation | `cancel` or drop: the puller's read fails, never EOF (§1.5) | drop an unread transfer: `STOP_SENDING(REJECTED)` |

Failure modes, from the pusher's side:

| Event | `send` | `delivered()` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Path unknown / wrong pattern | `UnknownEndpoint` / `Unsupported`, or `Ok` if the transport acknowledged first (§1.6) | same |
| Connection lost before FIN | `ConnectionLost` | — |
| Connection lost after FIN | `Ok` (the FIN was queued) | `Indeterminate` |
| Puller refused mid-transfer | `Rejected` | `Rejected` |

Round-robin is per message, and a peer is skipped only once its connection is closed; a peer
that is merely slow keeps receiving its share and eventually stalls the pusher through its
windows. Spreading work by capacity rather than by turn is broker work (L2).
*`push_round_robins_two_peers`*.

## 4. Pub/Sub

One unidirectional stream per subscriber per message, opened by the publisher's per-subscriber
writer. Filters are **segmented patterns** carried in SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE frames: segments
separated by `.`, `*` for exactly one whole segment, a trailing `#` for zero or more segments,
everything else literal ([PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) §6.4,
[decisions/0007](decisions/0007-topic-namespace.md) §4.2). `sensors.*.temp` selects one
segment, `sensors.#` selects `sensors` and everything under it, and `sensors.temp` does *not*
select `sensors.temperature` — which a byte prefix did, and which is the reason the grammar
changed. Endpoint **paths** are untouched by any of this: they stay opaque and are matched
exactly [0007 §4.1].

| | `Publisher` (`Pub`) | `Subscriber` (`Sub`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compatible peer | `Subscriber` | `Publisher` |
| Direction | binds | connects |
| Send/receive pattern | `publish(topic, bytes)`: synchronous, returns the number of subscribers reached; `open(topic)` for a payload written chunk by chunk (§4.1) | `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`, then `recv` |
| Incoming routing | — | one bounded queue (`endpoint_queue`) over every peer |
| Outgoing routing | fan-out to every subscriber whose filter matches, one copy each | — |
| Action with no peer | `publish` returns `0`; nothing is queued for a subscriber that does not exist yet | `recv` waits; `peer_count` is the only sign that the publisher is gone |
| Transport | one server-opened unidirectional stream per (subscriber, message) | |
| Ordering | `None`; one subscriber's copies are enqueued in publication order, but that is not a guarantee | |
| Delivery signal | none, and none is possible: `publish` never awaits a subscriber | none |
| Backpressure | `Drop`: a copy that does not fit in `subscriber_buffer_bytes` for that subscriber is dropped and counted in `dropped()`, and per topic and cause in `dropped_on(topic)` / `drops()` — budget, full queue, or no parked connection on a socket transport — so a starving signal can be named rather than inferred; the publisher never blocks | a subscriber that stops reading fills its budget at the publisher and then loses messages |
| Payload | whole `Bytes`, at most `subscriber_buffer_bytes`; larger is `LimitExceeded` before fan-out — **or unbounded through `open`**, where the budget bounds one chunk (§4.1) | |

Failure modes:

| Event | Publisher | Subscriber |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slow subscriber | drops for that subscriber only, `dropped()` grows and `dropped_on(topic)` says which topic and why | silently misses messages: nothing on the wire says so |
| Subscriber's connection lost | its filters and writer are removed | `recv` keeps waiting; `peer_count` drops |
| Publisher's connection lost | — | `recv` keeps waiting; filters are remembered and re-sent on the next `connect` |
| Too many filters on one connection | closes it with `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | `connect`/`subscribe` fails |
| Message beyond the budget | `LimitExceeded`, nothing sent | — |
| Streamed transfer a subscriber cannot keep up with | that subscriber's stream is reset with `CANCELED` and the drop counted; the others keep receiving | a partial payload, ended by a reset rather than a FIN, so it is never mistaken for a whole one |

This is the one place weida answers overload by discarding, and it is confined to fan-out
([GUARANTEES.md](GUARANTEES.md) §6). Today a subscriber cannot detect a drop; **subscriber-side
drop detection is what the sequence key of [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) §6.2 exists for**
([decisions/0001](decisions/0001-sequence-field.md) §7.2). A subscriber that has negotiated
the detect level of `PerProducer` sees the gap — how many messages were missed, expected
against seen — without anything being held back, which is the honest answer to a policy that
drops on purpose. The reassemble level holds messages instead, bounded by
`Limits::max_reorder_hold` and releasing the oldest held transfer with its gap reported at
the cap, at the buffer cost measured in [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) §4 (B-010).
Both are **on the wire and implemented**: DATA keys 6 and 7 carry the sequence and the
producer ([PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) §6.2), and a fan-out drop reaches a detecting
subscriber as a `Gap`.

### 4.1 Streaming fan-out: a payload the publisher never holds

`Publisher::open(topic)` returns a `FanOut`: one stream per matched subscriber, written
chunk by chunk. It exists because `publish` takes a whole `Bytes` and refuses anything above
`subscriber_buffer_bytes` — so a 33 MB video frame could not be published at all, and
raising the limit would have bought a per-subscriber copy of it inside the publisher, which
is exactly the materialization [INVARIANTS.md](INVARIANTS.md) forbids (B-064,
[requirements/zeughaus-video.md](requirements/zeughaus-video.md) request 1). With `open` the
budget bounds a **chunk**, one `Bytes` allocation is shared by every copy, and the payload
has no ceiling.

| | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `write_within(chunk, limit)` | waits up to `limit` for a subscriber with no room, then drops **that** subscriber's copy. The bound is mandatory and finite for the reason `drain(Duration)`'s is ([decisions/0009](decisions/0009-drain.md) §4.4): an unbounded wait is how a publisher hangs on a peer, and never waiting would make a payload larger than the budget undeliverable to anybody — the publisher would outrun its own budget and abort every copy |
| `write_now(chunk)` | never waits: a subscriber without room right now loses the transfer. Fan-out's `Drop` in its purest form, and the right call where a later chunk supersedes an earlier one |
| `finish()` | FIN on every remaining copy; returns how many subscribers got all of it as far as this side can tell. A fan-out copy carries no receipt, so the acknowledgement is the drain's business and nobody else's |
| dropping the handle | resets every copy, so no subscriber mistakes a partial payload for a whole one |

**This is also v0's conflation**, and that is decided rather than a workaround
([decisions/0016](decisions/0016-conflation.md) §4.3): a producer that wants "keep the newest,
discard the rest" holds one slot for the latest value, publishes it with `open` plus
`write_now`, and sets `subscriber_buffer_bytes` to about one value — then a subscriber that
falls behind loses that value and receives the next one, which is what a conflating queue would
have done for it. The transport grows no key for it, because the producer already has one.

Two things are deliberately unlike `publish`. The subscriber set is **fixed at `open`**: a
subscriber that arrives mid-payload would receive a fragment with no way to know it, so it
gets the next message. And the drop is per subscriber and per *transfer* rather than per
message — a subscriber that misses one chunk loses the whole payload, because half a frame is
not a frame. Both are counted exactly like any other fan-out drop, in `dropped_on(topic)`.

## 5. Raw streams: `Peer` and `Acceptor`

The L0 core, for topologies the patterns do not cover. A `Peer` dials and opens either stream
kind; an `Acceptor` binds one path and receives both kinds as `Incoming::Stream` or
`Incoming::Exchange`. Everything in §1 applies without translation, and nothing else is added:
no selection policy beyond round-robin over peers, no fan-out, no filters.

Two things the patterns cannot express are natural here:

- **A long-lived stream.** Open once, write many messages with a framing of your own, and the
  transport orders them for you — the only ordered channel weida has, and one every transport
  provides, since a stream is ordered bytes wherever it runs. Over QUIC it keeps its window
  and its place in the budget for as long as it is open, and its reader's pace is its writer's
  pace (§1.3); locally it keeps a descriptor instead (§1.10). A standing feed of frames to one
  viewer is this shape.
- **Both stream kinds on one path.** A control exchange and a bulk one-way stream to the same
  endpoint, dispatched by one accept loop.

*`acceptor_receives_both_stream_kinds`.*

## 6. PAIR, SURVEY and BUS

The three patterns [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §6b mapped and nobody had built. All
three are built now, and all three added **no wire vocabulary**: a `Paired` talks to a bare
`Peer` and `Acceptor` on the same path, a `Respondent`'s route is byte-for-byte a replier's, a
`BusMember`'s is a puller's. Router/Dealer stay emergent (§2); connecting publishers and
binding pushers stay recorded deferrals.

### 6.1 PAIR

`Runtime::pair` dials, `Listener::pair` binds, and after that the two are the same type with
the same calls: **one-way transfers in both directions**, one connection, one peer.

| | `Paired`, dialling | `Paired`, bound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compatible peer | a bound `Paired`, `Acceptor`, `Puller` | a dialling `Paired`, `Peer`, `Pusher` |
| Send/receive pattern | `connect` once, then `send`/`open` and `recv` concurrently | `send`/`open` and `recv` concurrently |
| Outgoing routing | the one connection it dialled | the one connection its peer dialled |
| Action with no peer | a second `connect` is `Error::LimitExceeded` | the first send **waits** for a peer to appear |
| Second peer | — | refused with `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, and the first is **kept** |

Two rules a caller can get wrong. **The first peer is kept**: ZeroMQ's PAIR drops the newcomer
silently, weida refuses it and says so, because a capacity decision is reported
([decisions/0005](decisions/0005-refusal-race.md)) — the refused sender reads
`Error::LimitExceeded` and the connection survives. And a **bound** pair cannot address a peer
it has not heard from, so its first send waits rather than buffering: a queue there would be a
guarantee nobody asked for.

`a_second_connection_is_refused_and_the_first_keeps_working`,
`a_pair_talks_to_a_bare_peer_and_acceptor_on_the_same_path`.*

### 6.2 SURVEY

`Surveyor::survey(body, deadline)` opens **one exchange per connected respondent** — not the
round-robin pick Req/Rep uses — and `SurveyRun::next(max_bytes)` yields answers as they arrive
until the deadline. A `Respondent` is a `Replier` with a different name: same route, same
`accept`, same backpressure.

| | `Surveyor` | `Respondent` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direction | connects, and **accumulates** peers on purpose | binds |
| Outgoing routing | every live peer, one exchange each | the exchange that asked |
| Deadline | the caller's, per survey; nothing on the wire carries it | never learns it |
| A late answer | dropped and **counted** in `late()` | cannot tell |
| No respondents | an empty run, not an error | — |

Three rules. The deadline is **not negotiated** and a respondent never learns it, so a survey
is a local decision about how long to wait. A late answer is counted **where it arrives**
rather than where the caller reads, so `late()` means "after the deadline" whatever the caller
does with its handle ([GUARANTEES.md](GUARANTEES.md) §6). And "nobody answered" is an answer:
a survey with no respondents returns a run whose first `next` is `None`, never
`Error::NotConnected`.

A respondent that refuses or dies mid-reply is **one `Err` among the answers** and ends
nothing: the exchanges are independent.

`a_respondent_that_dies_mid_reply_does_not_end_the_survey`,
`a_survey_with_no_respondents_is_empty_not_an_error`.*

### 6.3 BUS

`Listener::bus(path, tls)` is the only factory that takes both a path and dialling terms,
because a bus member is the one role that is **bound and dialling at once**. Joining is an
ordinary `connect`, leaving an ordinary disconnect; there is no membership protocol.

| | `BusMember` |
| --- | --- |
| Compatible peer | another `BusMember` on the same path |
| Send/receive pattern | `connect` per member, then `send` → every other member, `recv` |
| Outgoing routing | every member this one dialled; **never itself** |
| Backpressure | one writer per member; a full writer queue drops and counts |
| Ordering | `None` across members, per stream within one |
| Relay | none: *n* members is *n* × (*n* − 1) deliveries |

A message reaches every **other** member structurally — `send` writes to the peers this member
dialled, and a member does not dial itself — so nothing filters a copy out, because no copy is
ever addressed to it. There is **no relay**: weida forwards on nobody's behalf, which is the
trade nanomsg's BUS makes too. And the fan-out needs a **writer per member** for the same
reason Pub/Sub's does: without one, a member that stops reading stalls its stream tasks, the
sender exhausts `max_concurrent_uni_streams` and its next `send` blocks. With one, a slow
member costs its own copies — counted in `dropped()`, at the queue when it is full and at the
wire when a write fails — and never the sender's time.

## 7. Choosing

| You need | Use | Because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| an answer per message | Req/Rep | the reply is the strongest signal weida has (§2) |
| work distributed over workers, nothing lost under load | Push/Pull | backpressure is `Block`; the only losses are explicit refusals and `Indeterminate` after a loss (§3) |
| the newest of a feed, many readers, laggards may lose | Pub/Sub | drops are per subscriber and counted (§4) |
| ordered messages to one peer | a raw stream | QUIC orders bytes within a stream and nowhere else (§1.7, §5) |
| a signal larger than `subscriber_buffer_bytes` to many readers | `Publisher::open`, which streams one per subscriber (§4.1) | `publish` takes a whole `Bytes` and refuses it; `open` bounds a chunk instead (B-064) |
| proof the peer's application acted | Req/Rep, or an L2 broker (`weida-broker`) | a transport receipt never says that (§1.2); `Accepted`/`Stored`/`Processed` belong to a hop that owns the message, and a broker reports `Accepted` as a cursor (§1.11) |
| to know whether the receiver accepted it | Req/Rep | a one-way refusal can lose the race with the receipt and then reaches no observer (§1.6, [decisions/0005](decisions/0005-refusal-race.md) §4.3) |
| exactly one peer, both directions, no selection policy | PAIR | a second peer is refused rather than silently preferred (§6.1) |
| an answer from everyone who is there, within a deadline | SURVEY | the deadline, the partial result and the late-reply rule are what an application otherwise rebuilds wrongly (§6.2) |
| every member to hear every other member | BUS | *n* × (*n* − 1) deliveries, no relay, counted drops (§6.3) |
| a reliable verdict without an exchange | any pattern, plus `TransferMeta::with_report` | a cursor rides a stream of its own, so a Push transfer stays one unidirectional stream and still gets an answer (§1.11, [decisions/0024](decisions/0024-three-families-one-back-channel.md) §4.4a) |
| how far the far end got, not merely whether it finished | cursors, via `OutgoingTransfer::cursors` | a whole-message verdict tells an interrupted sender nothing; an absolute offset tells it a number (§1.11) |
