//! Named-pipe hygiene and the kernel's answer to *who is on the other end*,
//! on Windows.
//!
//! A pipe name is not a port either: the default security descriptor lets
//! Everyone read, the name can be squatted by whoever creates it first, a
//! server instance is a one-shot object that has to be recreated after every
//! accept, and a client that finds every instance taken gets
//! `ERROR_PIPE_BUSY` rather than a queue. Each of those has a known answer,
//! and the answers are the same for any protocol with an `ipc://`-style
//! transport ([decisions/0010](../../../docs/decisions/0010-local-transport.md)
//! §4.5, `docs/research/ipc.md` §3.1-§3.3).
//!
//! **Byte mode, not message mode.** 0010 §4.5 named message mode for the
//! kernel framing it gives; the grouping that was decided afterwards
//! ([0012](../../../docs/decisions/0012-local-connection-grouping.md)) makes
//! a connection carry one stream whose frames are the protocol's own, so
//! the kernel's framing would go unused — and `mio` reads a message-mode
//! pipe into a fixed buffer, where a message longer than the buffer is
//! `ERROR_MORE_DATA` and a read error rather than a partial read. The end of
//! a stream, which `AF_UNIX` signals by half-close and a pipe cannot, is the
//! consumer's to mark.
