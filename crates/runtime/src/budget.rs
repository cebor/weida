//! The bounded close budget.

use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

/// A finite budget for a shutdown, started once and spent by every phase of
/// it.
///
/// **Why the type exists.** A close has phases — stop admitting work, let
/// what is already finished reach the peer, then close the sockets and wait
/// for them to go idle — and each phase's wait is decided by somebody else's
/// network. Without one budget spanning all of them, the length of a close is
/// whatever the slowest peer makes it: QUIC's closing and draining periods
/// last about three times the path's probe timeout, and ZeroMQ's `ZMQ_LINGER`
/// defaults to infinite, which is why `zmq_ctx_term()` is known as a place
/// processes hang (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §12/P17). A process that must
/// exit within a budget of its own cannot use an API like that
/// ([decisions/0009](../../../docs/decisions/0009-drain.md) §4.3, §4.4).
///
/// So: one budget, taken at the start, and each phase asks how much is left.
/// A phase that overruns leaves the next one [`Duration::ZERO`] rather than a
/// negative number, which is a bound that still holds rather than a wait that
/// starts over.
///
/// ```
/// # use std::time::Duration;
/// # use weida_runtime::CloseBudget;
/// let budget = CloseBudget::start(Duration::from_secs(1));
/// // First phase waits on `budget.remaining()`, and so does the next.
/// assert!(budget.remaining() <= Duration::from_secs(1));
/// assert_eq!(budget.limit(), Duration::from_secs(1));
