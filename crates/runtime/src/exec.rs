/// An `Exec` is a Tokio handle and nothing more. It never owns the runtime,
/// so a task holding one can neither keep the runtime alive nor drop it from
/// inside itself. Cloning is a handle clone.
///
/// **Why a type rather than plain `tokio::spawn`.** A library that calls
/// `tokio::spawn`, `tokio::time` or `tokio::net::lookup_host` directly
/// demands that *its caller* be inside a Tokio reactor, on the very thread
/// that called it. Holding an `Exec` moves that requirement into the library:
/// the reactor is wherever the `Exec` points, the caller may drive the
/// returned futures on any executor — `futures::executor::block_on`
/// included — and a grep for those three names over the library's own `src`
/// is the proof that no path escaped
/// (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5).
