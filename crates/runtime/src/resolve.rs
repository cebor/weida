//! Name resolution, and the seam that lets an application replace it.
//!
//! A name becomes a set of addresses, and **how** is not this library's
//! decision to fix. The default is the system resolver, which answers A and
//! AAAA and therefore one port for the whole set; that is exactly right for a
//! Kubernetes headless Service, where every Pod listens on the same container
//! port, and exactly wrong for a cloud load balancer, where one IP forwards
//! several ports to several backends. The second case is what DNS SRV
//! expresses — one host, one record per port — and what no A/AAAA answer can.
//!
//! So the shape is the one this workspace already uses for the decisions that
//! belong to the application: `Trust` decides what a dial believes,
//! `weida-amqp` takes the caller's `rustls::ClientConfig`, and a
//! [`Resolver`] decides what a name means. Shipping only the system resolver
//! and calling SRV unsupported would put a DNS stack in everybody's dependency
//! graph to serve one deployment shape; refusing SRV outright would make that
//! deployment shape unreachable. A seam does neither.

///
/// # The contract
///
/// - **Order matters.** The addresses are dialled in the order returned, so a
///   resolver that knows a preference expresses it by sorting. The caller
///   tries the next one when a dial fails.
/// - **`port` is the port the URL wrote, or `None` when it wrote none.**
///   `None` means the authority names a *set*
///   ([decisions/0020](../../../docs/decisions/0020-cluster-and-discovery.md)
///   §4.2), and it is the resolver that decides which ports that set listens
///   on: the system resolver uses [`DEFAULT_PORT`], an SRV resolver uses the
///   ports the records carry.
/// - **`max_addresses` is a cap, not a hint.** A resolver answer is remote
///   input, so returning more than asked for is a bug in the resolver
///   (`docs/INVARIANTS.md`); the caller does not re-truncate.
/// - **An empty answer is an error**, not an empty set: a caller with no
///   address has nothing to dial and deserves the reason.
///
/// # The `Exec`
///
/// Resolution runs on the runtime the library was given, not on an ambient
/// one: `tokio::net::lookup_host` needs a Tokio context, and a library that
/// demanded its caller be inside one would be the mistake `Exec` exists to
/// prevent. A resolver that spawns work does so through the handle it is
