//! A delivery is not a deletion: what settles a message, and what gives it
//! back (B-203).
//!
//! The claim this file exists for is the one that makes the broker a broker
//! rather than a fan-out with a buffer: **a message a consumer never reports
//! on comes back**. Before this slice, `Queue::take` deleted it and a consumer
//! that died between receiving the bytes and finishing its work took the
//! message with it — RabbitMQ's `no-ack` mode, which its own documentation
//! calls unsafe.
//!
//! Settlement is a **cursor**, not a reply: the delivery orders `Processed` on
//! its own DATA header and the consumer reports it on the cursor stream, so a
//! delivery keeps the one-way topology a queue delivery always had
//! ([0029](../../../docs/decisions/0029-a-report-is-relayed-a-certificate-is-not.md)).
//! Every consumer here therefore reads `transfer.reporter()` — the same
//! accessor any `Subscriber` has — and nothing in this file uses an
//! application reply.
