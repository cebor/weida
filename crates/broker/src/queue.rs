//! One queue: messages held in memory, under one byte budget — and the
//! deliveries it has handed out and not yet seen settled.
//!
//! Nothing here talks to a peer. The queue answers two questions — is there
//! room, and what is held — and the broker turns those answers into a confirm
//! or a refusal. It holds no state a restart could recover, which is why
//! `Stored` is not expressible anywhere in this crate
//! ([0018](https://git.doodleshnookie.net/tuco86/weida/blob/main/docs/decisions/0018-minimal-broker.md)
//! §4.2).
//!
//! **A delivered message is still this queue's.** Until a consumer reports
//! `Processed`, a message that has gone out lives in the `unsettled` table
//! and **keeps its charge** against the budget: it may come back, so it is
//! memory the queue still owes. That is the whole difference between this
//! queue and the one before B-203, where a delivery was a deletion and a
//! consumer that died took the message with it — RabbitMQ's `no-ack` mode,
//! which its own documentation calls unsafe.
