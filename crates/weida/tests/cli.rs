//! The `weida` binary, driven the way a user drives it (B-196).
//!
//! B-060 was verified by hand — four verbs, two transports, four exit codes —
//! and nothing repeated that. These tests assert what a *caller* observes and
//! nothing about how the binary is built: the address `serve` prints, the
//! payload on stdout with nothing else on it, and the exit codes a script
//! branches on. The binary's path comes from `CARGO_BIN_EXE_weida`, so there
//! is no new dependency and no assumption about the target directory.
//!
//! Every child is killed when its handle drops and every wait is bounded, so
//! a binary that hangs fails these tests instead of stalling the suite.
//!
//! The whole file is behind `generate`, because `serve` mints a self-signed
//! identity and the binary therefore carries `required-features =
//! ["generate"]`: without the feature there is no binary to exercise.
