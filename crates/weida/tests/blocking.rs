//! The blocking facade, from threads with no executor (B-194).
//!
//! These are plain `#[test]` functions: no `#[tokio::test]` anywhere, which
//! is the point — a synchronous caller has no reactor, and everything below
//! runs on the reactor `weida::blocking::Runtime` owns and never shows.
//!
//! One round trip per pattern, because what needs proving is that the facade
//! drives the asynchronous surface correctly, not that the patterns work: they
//! have their own suites. The fourth test is the one that earns its place
//! twice over — calling a blocking method from inside a Tokio runtime is the
//! one mistake that deadlocks instead of failing, and the facade refuses it.
