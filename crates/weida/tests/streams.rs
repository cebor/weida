//! How QUIC stream mechanics show through the weida API.
//!
//! Every test here defends one statement about flow control, stream budgets,
//! cancellation or connection liveness that an application can rely on — or
//! must not. The setups use deliberately tiny `Limits` so the phenomena appear
//! within tens of kilobytes and milliseconds instead of megabytes and seconds.
//!
//! Two conventions run through the file:
//!
//! * a stall is asserted as the *absence* of a progress marker on a channel
//!   within [`STALL`], never as elapsed wall-clock time;
//! * a spawned sender reports its progress with [`Stage`] markers, so a task
//!   that fails instead of blocking closes the channel and fails the assertion
//!   rather than looking like a stall.
