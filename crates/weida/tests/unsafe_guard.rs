//! One guard for every crate that allows `unsafe`, and for every crate that
//! says nothing about it (B-248).
//!
//! Most crates here set `unsafe_code = "forbid"` and are done. Seven cannot:
//! a PyO3 crate's `#[pyclass]`, `#[pymethods]` and `#[pyfunction]` expand to
//! `unsafe impl`s of PyO3's type-object traits, and the lint does not care
//! that the code came from a macro. So those manifests set
//! `unsafe_code = "allow"`, each under a comment asserting that **no `unsafe`
//! is written by hand in this crate** — and until this file existed, exactly
//! one of the seven had a test behind that claim
//! (`crates/py/weida-py-core/tests/no_handwritten_unsafe.rs`, which scanned
//! its own `src` and nothing else). Six claims with nothing behind them.
//!
//! The shape matters more than the coverage. This is **one test that walks the
//! manifests** rather than seven copies of one test, so a crate that gains the
//! allowance tomorrow is covered by the fact of having it: nobody has to
//! remember to copy a file. The same walk catches the other way a guarantee
//! goes quiet — a crate whose manifest says *nothing*, which permits `unsafe`
//! by default and claims nothing at all.
//!
//! Two deliberate exclusions:
//!
//! * **`fuzz/` crates.** Each declares its own `[workspace]`, so no
//!   workspace-wide build ever compiles them and no workspace lint applies;
//!   their manifests are `cargo-fuzz`'s shape rather than this repository's.
//! * **Generated code and dependencies.** The walk reads `src` only.
