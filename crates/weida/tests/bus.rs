//! BUS: n members, each bound and connected.
//!
//! The property that distinguishes a bus from a fan-out is the one nobody can
//! infer from the types: a message reaches every **other** member and never
//! the sender. Here it is structural — `send` writes to the peers a member
//! dialled, and a member does not dial itself — so the test is a check on the
//! structure rather than on a filter.
//!
//! There is **no relay**: a bus of *n* members is *n* × (*n* − 1) deliveries.
//! `every_member_sees_every_other_members_message` is what that costs, made
//! visible.
