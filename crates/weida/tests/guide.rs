//! The guide's claims, asserted against the guide's own programs.
//!
//! `docs/GUIDE.md` §1 makes five claims and `examples/guide_one_transfer.rs`
//! is the program that demonstrates each; §2 makes five more and
//! `examples/guide_many_peers.rs` is that chapter's program. This file drives
//! **those** files, included as modules, so what is asserted is the code a
//! reader runs and not a second copy of it written to be testable — the
//! discipline `crates/zmq/weida-zmq/tests/zguide_pirates.rs` already applies
//! to the zguide's recipes.
//!
//! One of chapter 1's claims is a **race**, and it is asserted as one: a
//! one-way transfer to a path nobody serves may be reported delivered,
//! because the FIN can be acknowledged before the dispatcher's refusal
//! travels back ([decisions/0005](../../../docs/decisions/0005-refusal-race.md)).
//! Pinning either side of that would be pinning a coin flip; what the test
//! pins is the guarantee that survives it — the answer is never
//! `Indeterminate`, and the same misroute as an exchange is definite.
//!
//! Chapter 2's claims are about a fan-out, where the same discipline applies
//! to **rates**: how many messages a stalled subscriber absorbs before the
//! first loss is a property of the connection on the day, so the tests assert
//! the *mechanism* — that nothing is dropped while the publisher is paced,
//! that something is once it is not, and which counter names it — and print
//! the numbers rather than pinning them.
