//! What per-subscriber fan-out costs, at a width worth the name (B-247).
//!
//! weida gives every subscriber its own unidirectional stream per message, so
//! a stream nobody reads does not delay its siblings ([`PATTERNS.md`] §1.3).
//! That isolation is the argument for the design and nothing in this
//! repository had priced it: the largest fan-out ever measured here was
//! **eight** subscribers, in `patterns.rs`. The guide's C8B arithmetic rests
//! on the width one node holds ([`GUIDE.md`] §0.1), which makes this the one
//! number the whole depth argument stands on.
//!
//! Three things are measured, at widths 1, 16 and 256:
//!
//! 1. **What the publisher pays per message.** `publish` is synchronous and
//!    never waits on a subscriber, so its cost is `width` matcher walks,
//!    `width` queue pushes and `width` budget reservations — linear in the
//!    width by construction, and the question is the constant.
//! 2. **What a subscriber waits.** Median and tail of the delay between the
//!    `publish` call and the payload arriving in a subscriber's
//!    `IncomingTransfer`, over every copy of every message.
//! 3. **Which of the two bounds binds first.** A fan-out node is limited by
//!    per-connection transport state (B-011 measured 750-850 KiB per
//!    connection, both ends together) and by
//!    `Limits::subscriber_buffer_bytes`, the 8 MiB a slow subscriber may hold.
//!    The second half of this bench stalls every subscriber and publishes
//!    until the drop counter moves, which is the only way to see what those
//!    8 MiB per subscriber actually cost in resident memory.
//!
//! One client runtime per subscriber, as in `connections.rs`: a subscriber
//! claims its path in its connection's namespace, so subscribers cannot share
//! a pooled connection, and both ends of every connection live in this
//! process. Loopback QUIC, `RuntimeConfig::default()`, 1 KiB payload. The
//! machine and the numbers are in [`IMPLEMENTATION.md`] — read them as one
//! desktop's shape, not as a portable constant.
