//! The guide's chapter 2: **many peers, and the drop.**

//! ```text
//! cargo run -p weida --example guide_many_peers
//! ```
//!
//! Five programs, one per claim `docs/GUIDE.md` §2 makes, in the shape
//! chapter 1's program established: each returns its outcome as a **value**
//! rather than printing it, so `crates/weida/tests/guide.rs` asserts the code
//! a reader runs rather than a second copy written to be testable.
//!
//! Chapter 1 had one peer on each side, which is the only configuration in
//! which a send has no policy. From two peers on, every pattern has to answer
//! the same three questions — which peer, what if it cannot keep up, and who
//! else is affected — and the answers are different per pattern on purpose.
