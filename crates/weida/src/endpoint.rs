//! L1: typed endpoints, one `Endpoint<P>` per messaging pattern.
//!
//! The pattern is a type parameter rather than a runtime mode flag, so a
//! requester cannot be asked to accept and a replier cannot be asked to dial
//! (master doc §3). The trait is sealed: patterns are part of the protocol.
//!
//! Everything here is a thin wrapper over the stream core ([`crate::stream`]):
//! Req/Rep is one bidirectional stream per exchange, Push/Pull is a
//! unidirectional stream per message with round-robin peer selection, Pub/Sub
//! is the same stream with fan-out selection and publisher-side filtering. No
//! pattern adds a guarantee QUIC does not already provide; the vocabulary of
//! stored/replicated/processed belongs to a broker layer that does not exist
//! yet (`docs/GUARANTEES.md`).
