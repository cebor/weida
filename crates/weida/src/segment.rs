//! Segments: the L0 unit a radio fans out and a dialling `Peer` sends
//! ([decisions/0037](../../../docs/decisions/0037-layered-segments.md) §4.2).
//!
//! A **segment** is a unit whose parts may depend on each other and on
//! nothing earlier — a voice frame, a raw preview frame, a video GOP. It is
//! numbered per `(sender, path, topic)` in DATA key `13`. The machinery here
//! is shared by [`crate::Radio::segment`], one copy per joined dish, and
//! [`crate::Peer::segment`], one copy toward the bound path the peer dialled.
//!
//! A segment carries **layers** `0..MAX_SEGMENT_LAYERS`, ordered by
//! dependency: layer *k* may depend on layers below it and never above
//! (§4.3). Each `(copy, layer)` is its own uni stream, opened on that layer's
//! first chunk, with its own writer task and queue of [`COPY_QUEUE`] chunks;
//! the byte budget is per copy. Every cut removes a suffix of the layers, so
//! what a receiver gets is a prefix a decoder can use:
//!
//! * **the cut rule** — a copy without room for a chunk of layer *k* first
//!   cuts its layers above *k*, whose queued bytes return to the budget at
//!   once; still without room, in the budget or in layer *k*'s queue, it cuts
//!   *k* and above. Layer 0 cut means the copy lost the segment;
//! * **supersession** — opening segment *n+1* resets at once every layer of
//!   segment *n* on that topic whose writer had not finished it, or whose
//!   queued chunks the transport does not take at once, and every layer
//!   above it; a finished layer gets the time its path needs,
//!   `rtt + 50 ms + rtt * bytes / cwnd`, and is reset only if still
//!   unacknowledged then. A copy that follows upstream
//!   ([`SegmentTerms::follows_upstream`]) is treated as finished until a
//!   write has to wait. No other topic's copies are touched;
//! * **expiry** — the smaller of the sender's and the receiver's `max_age`,
//!   on the sender's clock from the segment's open.
//!
//! Each copy counts at most once in `TopicDrops::layers_cut` and at most once
//! under a whole-segment cause. Nothing here ever waits for a receiver:
//! [`Segment::write_layer`] is synchronous.
