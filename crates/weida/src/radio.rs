//! RADIO/DISH: lossy fan-out of segments
//! ([decisions/0034](../../../docs/decisions/0034-late-is-lost.md) §4.6).
//!
//! A **segment** is a unit whose parts may depend on each other and on
//! nothing earlier — a voice frame, a raw preview frame, a video GOP — and it
//! is the join point. A radio numbers segments per topic (DATA key `13`) and
//! sends each to every dish joined when it opens, one uni stream per dish.
//! Three things drop a copy, and each is counted per topic and cause:
//!
//! * **supersession** — opening segment *n+1* resets every copy of segment
//!   *n* on that topic that is still unacknowledged: at once if the radio had
//!   not finished it, otherwise after its path had the time to carry it (the
//!   finish grace), and no other topic's;
//! * **expiry** — a dish's `max_age`, on the radio's clock from the segment's
//!   open;
//! * **the dish's budget** — `subscriber_buffer_bytes` of chunks a copy may
//!   hold unwritten, and a queue of [`COPY_QUEUE`] chunks.
//!
//! Nothing here ever waits for a dish: [`Segment::write`] is synchronous.
//! The dish in turn discards a segment not newer than the newest it delivered
//! on the topic on that connection and never blocks its connection on a full
//! queue.
