//! Where an identity comes from: a source rather than a value
//! ([decisions/0032](../../../docs/decisions/0032-identity-sources-and-the-handoff.md)).
//!
//! An [`IdentitySource`] yields the current [`Identity`] and changes under
//! whoever holds it: a binding serves the certificate of the moment to the
//! next handshake without re-binding, a dialling endpoint presents it on its
//! next connection. Three sources live here — a static value, an ephemeral
//! generated identity, and a directory of files that is bootstrapped and
//! reloaded — and an external source (`weida-openbao`) drives one through
//! [`IdentitySource::update`]. A [`TrustSource`] is the same shape for the
//! anchors and pins a peer is judged by.
//!
//! What a source changes and what it does not: weida's fingerprint is the
//! key's, so a certificate renewed under the same key is invisible to every
//! pinning peer, while a new key is a new peer
//! ([0008](../../../docs/decisions/0008-session-identity.md) §4.2,
//! [0031](../../../docs/decisions/0031-transparent-redial-and-the-sender-outbox.md)
//! §4.7). The events say which of the two happened.
