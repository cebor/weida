//! The process-level runtime: configuration, the client connection pool,
//! shutdown, and the one place this crate touches the async runtime.

//! Every task, timer and name lookup in `weida` goes through [`Exec`], which
//! lives in `weida-runtime` and is re-exported here. That is what lets a
//! caller drive weida from an executor that is not Tokio: `quinn` needs a
//! Tokio reactor for its sockets and timers, nothing else here does, so the
//! reactor is an implementation detail the runtime owns rather than an
//! ambient requirement on every caller.
