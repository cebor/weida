//! Client connection pool.
//!
//! One QUIC endpoint per runtime and **one connection per dialled endpoint
//! path** ([decisions/0002](../../../docs/decisions/0002-control-and-bulk-separation.md)
//! §6.2). The path is part of the key, so a slow reader on one path cannot
//! stall a writer on another: they share no connection and therefore no
//! receive window, which is the only isolation QUIC actually gives
//! (`docs/PATTERNS.md` §1.3).
//!
//! The rest of the key is the authority as written, the trust configuration
//! and the fingerprint the address named, rather than the resolved address:
//! the TLS server name comes from the same string, so two spellings of one
//! address are genuinely different peers as far as authentication is
//! concerned.
//!
//! **The connections of one peer are bound together by the proved
//! fingerprint, and by nothing else**
//! ([decisions/0008](../../../docs/decisions/0008-session-identity.md) §4.2).
//! Dialling a second path is dialling the same peer, so the pool checks that
//! the peer that answers is the one that answered before and refuses the
//! connection otherwise — the load-balancer case, where two dials to one
//! authority reach two different servers.
