//! Publisher-side subscription registry and fan-out.
//!
//! A publisher does not know its subscribers: they arrive as SUBSCRIBE frames
//! on whatever connections the listener has accepted. This module owns that
//! mapping and the one genuinely new selection policy in Phase 3 — fan-out
//! (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, pattern primitive P3). Everything else a published
//! message needs is the ordinary one-way transfer path.
//!
//! **Delivery is per-subscriber best effort.** Each subscriber has a byte
//! budget; a message that does not fit is dropped for that subscriber, counted,
//! and the publisher moves on. A slow consumer therefore costs the publisher
//! nothing but its own messages (master doc §17: telemetry fan-out tolerates
//! drops and cannot tolerate a stalled producer).
