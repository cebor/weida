//! The `AF_UNIX` transport: `weida+unix://<percent-encoded-path>/<path>`.
//!
//! `SOCK_STREAM` on a filesystem path, and the peer proved by `SO_PEERCRED`
//! / `LOCAL_PEERCRED`
//! ([decision 0010](../../../docs/decisions/0010-local-transport.md) §4.4,
//! §4.5). The grouping of connections into peers is [`crate::grouped`]; this
//! module is only what a unix socket contributes to it: how it is dialled,
//! how the kernel names its peer, and how its payload ends.
//!
//! **A half-close is not an abort, and that used to be a silent loss.** The
//! kernel ends a socket's write direction one way: a shutdown the reader sees
//! as EOF. There is no abort to pair with it — `SO_LINGER` with a zero timeout
//! plus `close` is byte-for-byte a plain close at the reader — so a cancelled
//! transfer, a dropped `OutgoingTransfer` and a producer that died mid-payload
//! all arrived as a *complete* payload, and an application read half a message
//! for a whole one with nothing on the wire to warn it (B-245). Three
//! documents asserted the guarantee for every transport while this one did not
//! have it.
//!
//! So the payload is framed, in [`crate::chunked`]'s chunks — the framing the
//! named-pipe transport has always used, now shared rather than duplicated, so
//! the two socket transports have one convention and one reader. The cost is
//! five bytes per write and the zero-copy read, which
//! [0012 §4.7(e)](../../../docs/decisions/0012-local-connection-grouping.md)
//! priced before choosing it.
