//! Per-producer sequencing, gap detection and reassembly.
//!
//! One sender-side counter and two receiver-side modes, the two of
//! [decision 0001](../../../docs/decisions/0001-sequence-field.md) §7.5.
//! *Detect*, the default: report the gap and **deliver messages as they

//! whose predecessors are missing and release the run in sequence order,
//! accepting head-of-line blocking above QUIC in exchange, with the hold
