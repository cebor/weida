//! `weida` — exercise an endpoint from a shell.
//!
//! Every example in this repository is a Rust file, so the shortest way to
//! find out whether an endpoint is reachable used to be to write and compile a
//! program. This binary is the first useful slice of the phase-11 tracker row
//! ([IMPLEMENTATION.md](../../../docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §1, B-060): four verbs
//! over the same library the examples use, with the payload on stdin and
//! stdout so it composes with everything else in a pipeline.
//!
//! ```text
//! weida serve --echo   weida://0.0.0.0:7443/echo [--identity PATH] [--cert-out PATH]
//! weida serve --sink   weida://0.0.0.0:7443/sink [--identity PATH]
//! weida serve --pub    weida://0.0.0.0:7443/md   [--identity PATH]
//! weida request        weida://sha256:…@host:7443/echo [FILE]
//! weida send           weida://sha256:…@host:7443/sink [FILE]
//! weida sub            weida://sha256:…@host:7443/md [--filter F] [--count N]
//! ```
//!
//! **What goes where.** The payload — the request body, the reply, a published
//! message — is the only thing on stdout, so `weida request … | sha256sum`
//! means what it looks like. Addresses, receipts, topics and diagnostics go to
//! stderr. `serve` is the one exception: the addresses it prints *are* its
//! output, in the sense that a client needs nothing else, so they go to stdout
//! exactly as `transform_server` prints them.
//!
//! **Trust.** A `weida://sha256:…@host:port/path` address names the key that
//! must answer and needs no file (`Trust::by_address`); `--ca PATH` trusts a
//! certificate as an anchor instead and then a plain address is verified
//! against its names. A local transport (`weida+unix://`, `weida+pipe://`,
//! `weida+inproc://`) has no key at all: the kernel proves the peer, and an
//! address carrying a fingerprint is refused rather than quietly ignored
//! ([decisions/0010](../../../docs/decisions/0010-local-transport.md) §4.8).
//!
//! **Exit codes**, so a script can branch on the error vocabulary rather than
//! on a message:
//!
//! | Code | Meaning |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `0` | the operation completed |
//! | `1` | any other failure, including `Indeterminate` |
//! | `2` | usage |
//! | `3` | the peer refused the payload (`Rejected`) |
//! | `4` | no endpoint is registered under that path (`UnknownEndpoint`) |
//! | `5` | the request was accepted and no reply will exist (`NoReply`) |
//! | `6` | the key that answered is not trusted (`Untrusted`) |
//! | `7` | the connection was lost, or was never established |
//!
//! `1` rather than a code of its own for `Indeterminate` is deliberate: a
//! script must not be able to treat "I do not know whether it arrived" as a
//! definite outcome by matching a number
//! ([FAILURE_MODEL.md](../../../docs/FAILURE_MODEL.md)).
