//! Bounded deduplication: `Deduplication::Bounded(window)`.
//!
//! A receiver remembers the identity of what it has seen for a while and
//! suppresses a repeat of it. The identity is the triple
//! `(producer, scope, sequence)` — the producer being the connection's proved
//! fingerprint unless DATA key `7` names another one
//! ([decision 0008](../../../docs/decisions/0008-session-identity.md) §4.4) —
//! and "for a while" is the negotiated window
//! ([decision 0001](../../../docs/decisions/0001-sequence-field.md) §7.6).
//!
//! Two bounds, not one. The window bounds *how long* an identity is kept; it
//! says nothing about how many arrive inside it, so the table is additionally
//! capped in count and evicts its oldest entry at the cap — the bound
//! `docs/INVARIANTS.md` names for exactly this structure. And like the
//! sequencer beside it, the whole thing is inert when deduplication is off:
//! no entry is recorded and no table is allocated.

/// The identity of one transfer, for suppression purposes.

/// `producer` is `None` in the ordinary case, where the producer *is* the

/// every transfer here, so keeping it out of the key costs 32 bytes less per
/// entry and changes nothing.
///
/// **The key owns its scope, and that was measured rather than argued
/// (B-040).** `is_duplicate` builds this key on every call, so `scope.into()`
/// allocates a `Box<str>` even on the two paths that insert nothing. The
/// allocation costs **~10 ns** per call, and the obvious way to avoid it —
/// a two-level `HashMap<Box<str>, HashMap<(producer, sequence), _>>`, whose
/// outer lookup borrows `&str` — is **not faster**: a second hash lookup
/// costs what the allocation cost, so the candidate measured 42.0-42.8 ns
/// against this shape's 41.1-41.3 ns on a miss and the same within noise on a
/// hit (`cargo bench -p weida --bench patterns -- dedup_key`,
/// `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` §4). Against a 1 KiB push at ~7.9 µs it is
/// 0.13 %, and deduplication is opt-in, so a default connection never pays it
/// at all. The flat key stays.
