//! Cursors: what a peer reports about one transfer, and how it gets here.
//!
//! A completion is a **cursor** — a level plus an absolute byte offset — not a
//! verdict
//! ([decisions/0023](https://git.doodleshnookie.net/tuco86/weida/blob/main/docs/decisions/0023-completion-is-a-cursor.md)).
//! Three properties follow, and all three are structural here rather than
//! promised:
//!
//! * **Coalescing is free.** [`CursorSet`] keeps the maximum offset per level,
//!   so a repeated or reordered record changes nothing and a `watch` channel —
//!   which keeps only the latest value — is the right carrier by construction.
//! * **Nothing waits on a cursor.** A report rides a unidirectional stream of
//!   its own, and every write on it is best effort: a peer that never reads its
//!   [`Cursors`] blocks no transfer, and a peer that never takes its
//!   [`Reporter`] fails none.
//! * **A set costs no allocation.** The entries array is fixed at
//!   `MAX_REPORT_LEVELS`, which is also the cap the decoder enforces, so a
//!   snapshot is a `Copy` value a reader can hold without touching the
//!   connection.
//!
//! There is no error variant on the reading side. `Cursors::changed` yields
//! `None` when the reporter FINed, when the stream was reset and when the
//! connection died, and the three are deliberately indistinguishable: a cursor
//! is never load-bearing, so "no more cursors" is the only fact a reader can
//! act on.
