//! The blocking facade: weida for a caller with no executor.
//!
//! Behind the `blocking` feature, which is **not** default. Everything else
//! in this crate is `async`, because the transport is, and that is right for
//! an application that already has a reactor. It is wrong for a script, a
//! test harness, a CLI or a thread pool that has none — and this repository's
//! four protocol libraries all learned that, one facade each
//! (`weida_zmq::blocking`, `weida_mqtt::blocking`, `weida_nng::blocking`).
//! This is the same shape for weida's own patterns (B-194, B-244) — for
//! **every role of every pattern**: Req/Rep, Push/Pull, Pub/Sub, PAIR, SURVEY
//! and BUS — and, since B-243, for the cursor surface of
//! [0023](../../../docs/decisions/0023-completion-is-a-cursor.md) as well:
//! [`Cursors`] is a report read by its caller, [`Reporter`] one written by it.
//! RADIO/DISH of [0034](../../../docs/decisions/0034-late-is-lost.md) is here
//! too ([`Radio`], [`Dish`]). The datagram **flow** is not: it is L0, and this
//! facade mirrors the patterns, not `Peer` and `Acceptor`, so a flow stays on
//! the asynchronous surface — where `Flow::send` never blocks anyway.
//!
//! One design question came with SURVEY rather than a translation, and it is
//! answered in [`Survey`]: a deadline-bounded fan-out of exchanges yields
//! answers as they arrive on the asynchronous surface, which is what a
//! reactor is for, while a synchronous caller has nothing to do between two
//! answers — so the blocking shape collects and returns counts.
//!
//! # It is a wrapper, and nothing else
//!
//! Every method here is a `block_on` around the asynchronous endpoint's own
//! method. **No protocol behaviour is decided twice**: HELLO, negotiation,
//! the dispatch rules, the drain, the limits and the guarantee sets belong to
//! the asynchronous surface, and this module cannot disagree with them
//! because it does not implement them. Two weidas in one crate would be a bug
//! that only shows up in the one the tests do not cover.
//!
//! What it adds is the shape a synchronous caller needs: a payload is a
//! `Vec<u8>` rather than a stream, and every receive takes an explicit
//! ceiling in bytes — [`IncomingTransfer::read_capped`](crate::IncomingTransfer::read_capped)'s
//! argument, passed through rather than defaulted, because a caller who
//! wants the whole payload in memory is the one who knows how much of it
//! there may be ([INVARIANTS.md](../../../docs/INVARIANTS.md)).
//!
//! A caller who needs the streaming surface — a payload too large to hold, a
//! reply written while the request is still arriving — wants the
//! asynchronous API, and every wrapper here hands it out
//! ([`Requester::endpoint`], [`Replier::endpoint`], and so on).
//!
//! # The reactor is the library's, and blocking a worker is refused
//!
//! [`Runtime::new`] builds a [`crate::Runtime::owned`] reactor: its threads
//! belong to this crate, are named, are sized by
//! [`RuntimeConfig::worker_threads`](crate::RuntimeConfig::worker_threads)
//! and die with the handle. The futures are then driven on the **calling**
//! thread with `futures::executor::block_on`, so two threads may each block
//! on their own endpoint, which is how every synchronous program is written.
//!
//! A caller who is already inside a Tokio runtime must not use this facade:
//! blocking a reactor worker parks the thread that has to drive what the
//! caller is waiting for, and the result is a deadlock with no message. That
//! mistake is **detected rather than documented** — every call checks for an
//! ambient runtime first and fails with [`Error::Runtime`] naming the fix —
//! because a deadlock is the one failure a user cannot debug from the
//! outside.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use weida::blocking::Runtime;

//! let runtime = Runtime::new(RuntimeConfig::default())?;
//! let requester = runtime.requester(Trust::by_address());
