//! Transparent redial: the policy a dialling endpoint redials under, and the
//! events it reports while doing so
//! ([decisions/0031](../../../docs/decisions/0031-transparent-redial-and-the-sender-outbox.md)).
//!
//! A dialled address outlives its connection. The slot [`crate::Peer`]
//! records for it is redialled by a runtime task under a [`ReconnectPolicy`],
//! and every transition of that slot is reported as a [`PeerEvent`] on the
//! endpoint's event stream. Nothing in here touches a payload: what a redial
//! restores is the transport and, for a subscriber, the filters it holds
//! itself; the peer kept nothing ([0008](../../../docs/decisions/0008-session-identity.md)
//! §4.5).
