//! The bounded drain of [decision 0009](../../../docs/decisions/0009-drain.md).
//!
//! `Runtime::shutdown` is abortive: it closes, and a FIN that was queued but
//! not yet acknowledged never lands [0009 §4.1]. A drain is the counterpart —
//! stop admitting, give the finished transfers their chance, then perform the
//! same close — and what it can wait for is exactly one thing: the peer's
//! **transport** receipt, the condition `Delivery::delivered()` reports
//! [0009 §4.2]. Nothing here waits for a peer application to read anything,
//! and nothing here goes on the wire [0009 §4.8].
//!
//! The state below exists because a fire-and-forget sender drops its
//! `Delivery` and with it the only handle that can observe the
//! acknowledgement. Such a receipt is parked **on its connection** instead of
//! being dropped, so that a later drain has something to wait on. A receipt
//! the application keeps is never parked: whoever holds it is doing the
//! waiting.
//!
//! Parking is on the send path, so it costs one uncontended lock on the
//! connection's own deque and a push — no runtime-wide structure, no polling
//! and no task. The set is walked only when it is full and once more at drain
//! time.
//!
//! It holds nothing new in the sense of
//! [`docs/INVARIANTS.md`](../../../docs/INVARIANTS.md) — a receipt is a
//! future over a stream that already exists — but it is a set, so it is
//! bounded: per connection, by the stream budgets already in `Limits`.
//! Both are local quantities; a peer cannot grow this by sending.
