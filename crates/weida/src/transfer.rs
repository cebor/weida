//! These own their `quinn` streams outright: payload bytes go straight to the
//! socket without passing through the connection actor, so writing and reading
//! a transfer costs no task hop and takes no lock (master doc §49). The actor
//! is involved only for the two control frames a destructor may still need to
//! emit — and `finish()` costs one more thing, paid once at the end of a
//! transfer rather than per write: an unawaited `Delivery` hands its receipt
//! to the connection's parked set on drop, which is one uncontended lock and
//! a push, so that a drain can wait for it
//! (`docs/decisions/0009-drain.md` §4.2).
//!
//! Nothing here materializes a payload. `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` are the
//! primitive API; `collect(max_bytes)` is an opt-in convenience with an
//! explicit cap (master doc §8, §81 rule 3).
