//! L0: the stream core.
//!
//! This is the socket replacement, ZeroMQ's idea rebuilt directly on QUIC. Its
//! primitives are the two stream kinds QUIC gives us and nothing more:
//!
//! * a **unidirectional stream** — bytes in one direction, ended by a FIN, with
//!   a transport receipt ([`crate::Delivery`]) and refusal by stop code;
//! * a **bidirectional stream** — an *exchange*: the initiating half carries a
//!   request, the return half carries a reply or an ERROR.
//!
//! The guarantees are exactly QUIC's: in-order bytes within a stream, no order
//! across streams, flow control per stream and per connection, and cancellation
//! via reset/stop. Nothing here invents delivery semantics on top of that; the
//! patterns in [`crate::endpoint`] are thin wrappers over these two calls, and
//! broker semantics (queues, publisher confirms, consumer acks) belong to a
//! layer that does not exist yet.
