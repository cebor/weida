//! Interop against an independent ZeroMQ: the pure-Rust `zeromq` crate
//! ("zmq.rs") **0.6.0**, measured on 2026-09-11.
//!
//! Every other test in this crate drives our sockets against our own codec,
//! which is byte-exact against `docs/adapters/zmtp.md` §10.1 and therefore
//! faithful — and shares every assumption with the code under test. This
//! file is the other kind: an implementation that shares no code and no
//! assumptions with ours, where a disagreement is an interoperability bug
//! rather than a tautology. No supervised process and no C library: zmq.rs
//! is a dev-dependency, so `cargo test` is the whole apparatus.
//!
//! **Both roles, every pairing both implement.** Ten tests: for REQ/REP,
//! DEALER/ROUTER, PUSH/PULL, PUB/SUB and XPUB/XSUB, once with our socket
//! **bound** and zmq.rs connecting, once with our socket **connecting** and
//! zmq.rs bound. PAIR is absent from the matrix because zmq.rs does not
//! implement it (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §13), which is a gap in the peer
//! and not a disagreement.
//!
//! # The three skews, exercised rather than assumed
//!
//! `docs/research/zeromq.md` §13 records three things about zmq.rs 0.6. Each
//! has a test here that fails if we stop accommodating it:
//!
//! 1. **It announces ZMTP 3.0.** Every test in this file proves we accept a
//!    3.0 greeting, because none of them would connect otherwise.
//! 2. **It decodes exactly one command, `READY`.** Anything else is "Unknown
//!    command received" and the connection dies. So `ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_IVL` must
//!    not produce a `PING` against a 3.0 peer, and
//!    [`a_heartbeat_is_suppressed_against_a_three_zero_peer`] sets a 50 ms
//!    interval, talks for two seconds, and asserts the connection lives —
//!    which it could not do if a single `PING` had gone out.
//! 3. **Its subscriptions are ZMTP 2.0's one-frame message form.** Our
//!    default is the 3.x `SUBSCRIBE` command, which zmq.rs's publisher
//!    cannot read, so a subscriber of ours must be configured with
//!    [`SubscriptionForm::LegacyMessage`].
//!    [`the_command_subscription_form_is_not_understood_by_zmq_rs`] measures
//!    both directions of that: the command form delivers nothing and the
//!    legacy form delivers.
//!
//! # Disagreements measured against zmq.rs 0.6.0
//!
//! * **Subscriptions.** As skew 3. zmq.rs's `SubSocket` and `XSubSocket`
//!   send the `%x01`/`%x00` message form and its `PubSocket`/`XPubSocket`
//!   read only that form. We accept both on the way in and choose the form
//!   we send with `SubscriptionForm`; against zmq.rs the legacy form is
//!   mandatory, and against libzmq either works. Recorded, not worked
//!   around: the option exists for this.
//! * **Heartbeats.** As skew 2. A `PING` is fatal to zmq.rs 0.6, so our
//!   heartbeat is gated on the negotiated version rather than on the option.
//!   The cost is named where it is paid: a 3.0 peer gets no liveness check
//!   at all.
//! * **An XPUB applies a subscription only when the application receives
//!   it.** zmq.rs 0.6's `XPubSocket::recv` calls `message_received` on its
//!   backend and then hands the message on (xpub.rs:181-204); a publisher
//!   that never calls `recv` has no subscribers and drops everything.
//!   libzmq applies the subscription in the socket unless
//!   `ZMQ_XPUB_MANUAL` is set, and so do we — for us that behaviour is the
//!   option and not the default.
//!   [`our_xsub_subscribes_to_a_zmq_rs_xpub`] therefore reads the
//!   subscription on their side before publishing, and says so.
//! * **Their DEALER announces no routing id.** So the id our ROUTER routes
//!   it by is one we generated, which is 37/ZMTP's own rule ("the Identity
//!   property shall be ignored" for all but the REQ/DEALER/ROUTER peers of
//!   a ROUTER, and a peer that announces none gets one). Not a
//!   disagreement, but it is the reason
//!   [`our_router_routes_a_zmq_rs_dealer`] asserts a non-empty id rather
//!   than a particular one.
//! * **An empty subscription.** zmq.rs's `SubSocket::subscribe("")`
//!   subscribes to everything, as ours does, and our publisher's prefix
//!   match agrees with theirs on every topic tested.
//! * **Nothing else disagreed.** All ten pairings carried a message in both
//!   roles, in order where order is promised, with no adjustment on either
//!   side beyond the subscription form and the XPUB `recv` above.
