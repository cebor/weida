//! What a REQ/REP round trip costs in Rust, for B-117's comparison.
//!
//! The Python binding's round trip is measured by
//! `crates/zmq/weida-zmq-py/roundtrip_cost.py` with the same shape — one
//! request out, one reply back, over `inproc://` and over loopback `tcp://`,
//! at an empty payload and at 1 KiB — and the two numbers go into
//! `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` §4. This is the Rust half: the same library
//! without a language boundary in the middle.
//!
//! Not a criterion bench on purpose: what is wanted is one median against
//! another median measured the same way, and the Python side cannot be a
//! criterion bench. An example keeps both halves the same shape.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p weida-zmq --release --example roundtrip_cost
//! ```
