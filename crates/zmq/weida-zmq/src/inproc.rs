//! The `inproc` transport: a context-scoped namespace and a pair of buffers.
//!
//! `zmq_inproc(7)`: it "passes messages via memory directly between threads
//! sharing a single 0MQ context", involves no I/O threads, allows names up to
//! 256 characters, and **since libzmq 4.0 no longer requires bind before
//! connect** (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §12, §13). All four facts are here:
//!
//! - **The namespace belongs to the context.** A name bound in one context is
//!   invisible in another, because "two contexts are two separate ZeroMQ
//!   instances" (§2). It is `weida-runtime`'s [`NameRegistry`][weida_runtime::NameRegistry],
//!   which exists
//!   for exactly this shape — a set of names, one owner each, a queue from
//!   the dialler to the owner, and a byte budget on the name
//!   ([0010](../../../docs/decisions/0010-local-transport.md) §4.8). The
//!   budget is libzmq's 256, which is the same number weida's buses use.
//! - **No I/O threads, no kernel.** A connection is one
//!   [`tokio::io::duplex`] pair, so the session layer above it is the same
//!   code that runs over TCP: the greeting, the NULL handshake and the
//!   framing are the protocol's, not the transport's.
//! - **Connect before bind parks.** A dial to a name nobody holds waits for
//!   the bind instead of failing, which is the 4.0 behaviour. It is a wait on
//!   a [`Notify`], not a poll, so a connect that is never answered costs
//!   nothing.
//! - **The byte buffer is not the high-water mark.** The HWM is a message
//!   count on the [`crate::Pipe`] either side holds; the duplex buffer below
//!   is a byte window on the wire between them, which is also why libzmq
//!   warns that for `inproc` "sender and receiver share buffers; real HWM is
//!   the sum of both sides' configured HWMs" (§8).
