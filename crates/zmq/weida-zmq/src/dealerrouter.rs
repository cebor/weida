//! DEALER and ROUTER: request-reply with the state machine taken out.
//!
//! 28/REQREP, through `docs/research/zeromq.md` §4.2:
//!
//! - **DEALER** "works as an asynchronous replacement for REQ". Unrestricted
//!   in both directions: round-robin over the peers "available only when
//!   [they have] an outgoing queue that is not full", block or error when
//!   none is, never discard, fair-queue inbound. It adds **no envelope at
//!   all** — talking to a REP means the *application* writes the empty
//!   delimiter, which is what "must emulate REQ's envelope exactly" means.
//! - **ROUTER** "works as an asynchronous replacement for REP". It
//!   identifies each peer's double queue by a routing id and, inbound,
//!   prefixes the message with it; outbound it removes the first frame as
//!   that id and routes by it, and "SHALL either silently drop the message,
//!   or return an error, depending on configuration, if the queue does not
//!   exist, or is full". It "SHALL NOT block on sending".
//!
//! **The routing id is the whole of ROUTER.** "An identity (also called an
//! address) is a binary string whose only meaning is 'this is a unique handle
//! to the connection'". A peer may choose its own through the `Identity`
//! property of its `READY` — `ZMQ_ROUTING_ID` on its side — and a peer that
//! chooses none is given one, distinguishable by its leading zero
//! ([`RoutingKey`]). ROUTER learns a peer only when it has one, which is why
//! `ZMQ_PROBE_ROUTER` exists: it makes a new connection announce itself with
//! an empty message so that "an application can really reply" *and* speak
//! first.
//!
//! **Three ROUTER options change what happens at the edges**, and each is
//! libzmq's own: `ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY` turns the silent drop into
//! `EHOSTUNREACH` (or `EAGAIN` at the high-water mark),
//! `ZMQ_ROUTER_HANDOVER` lets a newcomer take an identity from an incumbent
//! rather than being rejected, and `ZMQ_PROBE_ROUTER` is set on the *peer*
//! rather than on the ROUTER.
