//! Socket options the connection engine reads, with libzmq's names, numbers
//! and sentinels.
//!
//! Two rules from
//! [0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.4 item 4
//! govern this module. An option is **honoured or refused**, never silently
//! ignored, so an unusable value fails where it is set rather than at the
//! first message. And every default here is libzmq's own
//! (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §11), except where 0013 §4.4 item 5 names the
//! deviation.
//!
//! **libzmq's sentinels become `Option`.** `-1` means "no reconnect" for
//! `ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL` and "no limit" for `ZMQ_MAXMSGSIZE`; `0` means "no
//! backoff" for `ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX`, "no limit" for `ZMQ_HANDSHAKE_IVL`
//! and "the OS default" for `ZMQ_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`. Three different meanings
//! for two numbers is a footgun in C and does not need reproducing: each one
//! is a `None` whose documentation says which libzmq value it is.
