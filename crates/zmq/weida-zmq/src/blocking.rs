//! The blocking facade: ZeroMQ for a caller with no executor.
//!
//! Behind the `blocking` feature, which is **not** default. libzmq's API is
//! synchronous, and most of a protocol library's audience has no reactor at
//! all; this module is that API, one wrapper per socket type, over a
//! [`Context::owned`] reactor the library owns and the caller never sees.
//!
//! # It is a wrapper, and nothing else
//!
//! Every method here is a `block_on` around the asynchronous socket's
//! own method. **No protocol behaviour is decided twice**: the mute actions,
//! REQ's alternation, ROUTER's routing table, the subscription forms, the
//! handshake and the timeouts are the async surface's, and this module
//! cannot disagree with them because it does not implement them. Two
//! ZeroMQs in one crate would be a bug that only shows up in the one the
//! tests do not cover.
//!
//! The three option groups a blocking caller asks about are the same:
//!
//! * `ZMQ_SNDTIMEO` and `ZMQ_RCVTIMEO` are
//!   [`SocketOptions::send_timeout`](crate::SocketOptions::send_timeout) and
//!   `recv_timeout`, honoured by the socket's own `send` and `recv` — passed
//!   down, never re-interpreted here.
//! * `ZMQ_DONTWAIT` is `try_send`/`try_recv`, which are already synchronous
//!   on every socket of this crate: no reactor is entered at all, because
//!   there is nothing to wait for.
//! * the explicit `*_timeout` forms take a bound per call, for the zguide's
//!   Lazy Pirate shape, which is a poll with a deadline rather than an
//!   option.
//!
//! Anything a pattern has beyond sending and receiving — `subscribe`, a
//! ROUTER's `peers`, XPUB's manual subscriptions, a monitor — stays on the
//! asynchronous socket and is reached through [`socket`](ReqSocket::socket),
//! because those calls are synchronous already. The facade adds the blocking
//! forms and nothing more.
//!
//! # The thread rule survives
//!
//! libzmq: "Do not use or close sockets except in the thread that created
//! them." A wrapper owns its socket, and the socket is `Send` and not `Sync`
//! (`crate::SocketCore`), so a wrapper may be moved to another thread and
//! may not be shared with one. Nothing here lends a socket to a pool.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use weida_zmq::blocking::{BlockingContext, RepSocket};
//! use weida_zmq::Multipart;
//!
//! # fn main() -> weida_zmq::Result<()> {
//! let context = BlockingContext::new()?;
