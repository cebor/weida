//! Subscriptions: the publisher-side table, its reference counts, and the two
//! wire forms.
//!
//! **Filtering is the publisher's job.** 37/ZMTP: filtering "SHALL happen at
//! the publisher side (the PUB or XPUB socket)", and "a subscription of 'A'
//! SHALL match all messages starting with 'A'. An empty subscription SHALL
//! match all messages" (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §4.3). So a publisher keeps
//! one of these per subscriber and compares each message's **first frame**
//! against it.
//!
//! **Subscriptions are additive and not idempotent**, which is a counting
//! rule and not a set rule: "subscribing to 'A' and 'A' counts as two
//! subscriptions, and would require two CANCEL commands to undo" (§2). A set
//! would lose that, so this is a multiset — and the count is exactly why the
//! table needs a ceiling, because a peer can open N of them with N commands.
//!
//! **Two wire forms exist and a widely interoperable implementation accepts
//! both.** The 3.x form is the `SUBSCRIBE`/`CANCEL` commands; the ZMTP 2.0
//! form is a one-frame *message* whose first octet is `%x01` for subscribe or
//! `%x00` for unsubscribe. Which one a 3.x peer sends "is not settled by the
//! specification", and `zeromq` 0.6 — the pure-Rust implementation the interop
//! bench uses — announces 3.0 and speaks only the 2.0 form (§4.3). They are
//! distinguishable on the wire, since a command frame carries the COMMAND
//! flag, so this library **accepts both** and lets the sent form be chosen.
