//! ZMTP over one connection: the greeting, the NULL handshake, the framing
//! and the heartbeat.
//!
//! This is the [`Session`] the connection engine hands every established
//! connection to. It is the same code for every socket type, because the
//! pattern is a *property* in `READY` and not a different wire format
//! (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §3) — what differs per socket type is which
//! peer types are legal opposite it, and that table lives in the codec.
//!
//! **Nothing byte-exact is written here.** `weida-zmtp` owns the greeting,
//! the flags octet, the size field, the command bodies and the property
//! dictionary, and its `[dependencies]` is empty so that it can be checked
//! against 37/ZMTP rather than against our reading of it
//! ([0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.3). This
//! module is I/O, sequencing and policy: which command answers which, when a
//! `PING` may be sent, and what a mismatch does.
//!
//! **The 3.0 downgrade is load-bearing.** 37/ZMTP permits a peer to
//! "downgrade to a lower protocol version", and the interop bench showed why
//! it must: the pure-Rust `zeromq` crate announces ZMTP 3.0 and answers any
//! command but `READY` with "Unknown command received" and a close
//! (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §13). So a 3.0 peer is accepted, and it gets no
//! `PING` — the version decides whether the heartbeat can be honoured, and a
//! suppressed heartbeat says so once rather than leaving a silently different
//! behaviour to be found in a packet capture.
//!
//! The behaviour here is ported from `crates/adapters/weida-zmtp-bridge`'s
//! `wire.rs` and `Liveness`, which is where it was first proved against real
//! ZeroMQ peers. The bridge keeps running on its own copy until B-094 rebuilds
//! it on this crate; nothing here touches it.
