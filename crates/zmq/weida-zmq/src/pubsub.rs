//! PUB and SUB: publish-subscribe, 29/PUBSUB.
//!
//! - **PUB** keeps one outgoing queue per subscriber, "SHALL perform a binary
//!   comparison of the subscription against the start of the first frame of
//!   the message", "SHALL silently drop the message if the queue for a
//!   subscriber is full", "SHALL NOT block on sending", and "SHALL silently
//!   discard any messages that subscribers send it"
//!   (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §4.3).
//! - **SUB** receives only, fair-queues its publishers, and "SHALL silently
//!   discard messages if the queue for a publisher is full".
//!
//! **The filtering is the publisher's**, which is why a SUB socket's
//! `subscribe` is a message on the wire rather than a local predicate: the
//! table lives beside the subscriber's queue on the publisher, and a
//! publisher with an empty table for a peer sends that peer nothing. A fresh
//! SUB therefore receives nothing at all until it asks, and an empty
//! subscription asks for everything.
//!
//! **Dropping is the point, not a compromise.** "PUB is used mainly for
//! transient event distribution where stability of the network (e.g.
//! consistently low memory usage) is more important than reliability of
//! traffic" — so a slow subscriber loses messages instead of slowing the
//! publisher down, and [`PubSocket::publish`] reports how many copies were
//! dropped rather than hiding it.
//!
//! **Both subscription wire forms are accepted and the sent one is
//! configurable** — see [`crate::SubscriptionForm`]. A publisher that read only the
//! 3.x commands would have no subscribers at all from `zeromq` 0.6, which
//! announces 3.0 and sends ZMTP 2.0's message form.
