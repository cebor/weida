//! Every `zmq_setsockopt` and `zmq_ctx_set` option, honoured or refused by
//! name.
//!
//! 0013 §4.4 item 4: an option is **honoured or refused, never silently
//! ignored**. The typed fields of [`SocketOptions`](crate::SocketOptions) and
//! [`ContextConfig`](crate::ContextConfig) are the honoured half — a value
//! this library cannot deliver already fails where it is set. This module is
//! the other half: the options libzmq has and this library does not, each
//! with the reason, so that a reader porting a `zmq_setsockopt` call finds an
//! answer rather than a silence.
//!
//! # Where the list comes from
//!
//! `docs/research/zeromq.md`: §2's context options, §4's per-pattern
//! options, §5's flow-control options, §10's security options, §11's limit
//! table and §13's 4.3.5 additions, plus the option names libzmq's
//! `zmq_setsockopt(3)` defines for the transports and mechanisms that sheet
//! names as absent. Nothing here is invented: every `ZMQ_*` below is an
//! option libzmq 4.3.5 accepts.
//!
//! **Read-only options are not in the table.** `ZMQ_EVENTS`, `ZMQ_FD`,
//! `ZMQ_LAST_ENDPOINT`, `ZMQ_SOCKET_LIMIT`, `ZMQ_MSG_T_SIZE` and
//! `ZMQ_MECHANISM` are `zmq_getsockopt`/`zmq_ctx_get` only, so there is no
//! configuration-time decision to record for them. `ZMQ_LAST_ENDPOINT` is
//! answered by [`crate::Engine`]'s own accessor.
//!
//! # The five reasons
//!
//! [`Refusal`] is closed on purpose: a refusal that could not be put in one
//! of these five would be an option nobody had thought about.
//!
//! # The two deliberate default changes
//!
//! 0013 §4.4 item 5. They are in the table as honoured options, and their
//! rows say where the changed default lives:
//!
//! * `ZMQ_LINGER` is infinite in libzmq and **finite** here
//!   ([`DEFAULT_CLOSE_BUDGET`](crate::DEFAULT_CLOSE_BUDGET)), because
//!   "termination waits forever" is how a ZeroMQ process hangs at shutdown.
//! * `ZMQ_MAXMSGSIZE` is "no limit" in libzmq and **bounded** here
//!   ([`DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`](crate::DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE)), because
//!   a frame may declare 2^63-1 octets and that option is the only defence.
//!
//! Both are settable back to anything the type allows; neither is silent.
