//! ZeroMQ's identities, kept apart from weida's on purpose.
//!
//! [0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.4 item 6 is
//! a compile-time rule, and this module is where it is kept: a routing id is
//! **1-255 self-asserted bytes whose first octet is nonzero**, and
//! `weida_core::Fingerprint` is the SHA-256 of a proved TLS public key. One is
//! a name a peer chose for itself; the other is what a peer demonstrated
//! possession of. **No `From`, `Into`, `AsRef` or `Deref` between the two
//! groups exists anywhere in this workspace, and none may be added** — that is
//! loss L6 of `docs/adapters/zmtp.md` §8 and the adapter rule of
//! [0008](../../../docs/decisions/0008-session-identity.md) §5 turned from
//! prose into a compile error. Where the two must meet — a bridge — the
//! meeting is a human's configuration decision, never a conversion.
//!
//! `weida_core::LocalPrincipal` is shared, because `ipc://` peer credentials
//! are the same kernel fact on both sides of the workspace. It is not a ZAP
//! identity and must not be presented as one.
