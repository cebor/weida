//! The per-peer queue — ZeroMQ's "pipe" — and what happens when it is full.
//!
//! **Every pattern RFC specifies the same object.** One queue per connected
//! peer, or a double queue, one per direction; created when an outgoing
//! connection is *initiated* and maintained "whether or not the connection is
//! established"; created when a peer connects; destroyed on that peer's
//! disconnect, "discarding any messages it contains"; with sizes constrained
//! "to a runtime-configurable limit" (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §2). That is
//! [`Pipe`], and the limit is `ZMQ_SNDHWM`/`ZMQ_RCVHWM`.
//!
//! **Credit is local and nobody grants it.** ZMTP 3.1 has no flow-control
//! signalling at all — credits are listed under "Topics for Discussion" — so
//! a high-water mark is purely a local bound on a local queue, applied per
//! peer, counted in *messages* rather than bytes (§5). It is also inexact in
//! libzmq: kernel socket buffers sit underneath it, "the actual limit may be
//! as much as 90% lower depending on the flow of messages", and for `inproc`
//! "the real HWM is the sum of both sides' configured HWMs" (§5, §11). What
//! is exact is the *behaviour at the bound*, which is what this module
//! implements and what its tests pin.
//!
//! **What happens at the bound is a property of the socket type**, from
//! `zmq_socket(3)`'s "Action in mute state" column: block, drop, or return
//! `EAGAIN` (§4.1). [`MuteAction::sending`] is that column, written once, so
//! that the socket types of the later slices carry it rather than each
//! re-deciding it at every send site.
//!
//! # A queue is bounded twice: in messages, as libzmq is, and in bytes
//!
//! libzmq's high-water mark counts messages, and a message may be as large as
//! `ZMQ_MAXMSGSIZE` allows, so the memory one peer can occupy is the
//! **product** of the two — 1000 × 1 MiB per direction per peer at the
//! defaults. Stating the product is honest but it is not a bound
//! ([`crate::DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`]), so every queue carries
//! [`QueueConfig::max_bytes`] as well: [`DEFAULT_QUEUE_BYTES`], 8 MiB, per
//! direction per peer.
//!
//! The two bounds are **not** the same thing said twice. `max_message_size` is
//! a ceiling and not a size: dividing the byte budget by it would cut
//! libzmq's documented default from 1000 messages to 8 for every socket,
//! including the ones whose messages are forty bytes. Enforcing bytes where
//! the bytes actually are keeps `ZMQ_SNDHWM` behaving exactly as
//! `zmq_setsockopt(3)` says it does and refuses only the peer that occupies
//! the memory.
//!
//! **A queue always accepts one message**, however large, which is why the
//! byte ceiling applies only to a queue that is not already empty. Without
//! that rule a message above the ceiling could never be queued at all, and a
//! blocking socket type would wait for room that cannot appear — a deadlock
//! in place of a bound. The exposure per direction per peer is therefore
//! `min(hwm, ...) × message size` capped at
//! `max_bytes - 1 + max_message_size`, i.e. **just under 9 MiB** at the
//! defaults, and `max_message_size` is what bounds the single-message case.
