//! XPUB and XSUB: the raw pub/sub types a proxy is built from.
//!
//! 29/PUBSUB, through `docs/research/zeromq.md` §4.3:
//!
//! - **XPUB** is "as PUB plus a double queue per subscriber, inbound
//!   messages fair-queued to the application, subscription commands
//!   delivered to the application, optional normalization so that multiple
//!   identical subscriptions result in a single command only", and it
//!   "SHALL, if the subscriber peer disconnects prematurely, generate a
//!   suitable unsubscribe request for the calling application".
//! - **XSUB** is "as SUB plus sending messages and subscriptions upstream";
//!   it "SHALL send all messages to all connected publishers", silently
//!   drops on a full outgoing queue and never blocks.
//!
//! **Subscriptions are messages here.** `zmq_socket(3)`: "byte 1 (for
//! subscriptions) or byte 0 (for unsubscriptions) followed by the
//! subscription body. Messages without a sub/unsub prefix are also received,
//! but have no effect on subscription status." That is what makes the pub/sub
//! proxy possible: an XPUB's application reads a subscription and writes it
//! into an XSUB, which puts it on the wire in whichever form that socket is
//! configured for.
//!
//! **The synthesized unsubscribe is the socket's memory, not the peer's.** A
//! subscriber's table dies with its connection, so an XPUB remembers what
//! each peer held and, when the peer goes, hands its application one `%x00`
//! per prefix — otherwise a proxy would keep forwarding a subscription
//! nobody holds any more. What that remembers is bounded by the same product
//! as everything else: `max_peers` peers times `max_subscriptions` prefixes.
