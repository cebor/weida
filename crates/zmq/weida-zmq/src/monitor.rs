//! `zmq_socket_monitor`'s event set, as a typed stream and as the
//! `inproc://` PAIR form.
//!
//! libzmq gives a socket's connection lifecycle to a PAIR socket bound on an
//! `inproc://` endpoint, two frames per event: a six-octet header and the
//! endpoint. That is what the zguide's Espresso recipe reads, so it has to
//! exist byte for byte. It is also a poor interface for a Rust caller, who
//! wants an enum.
//!
//! **Both, from one source.** [`MonitorEvent`] is the event; the engine
//! publishes it exactly once per transition; [`Monitor`] hands it to a Rust
//! caller as a value, and [`serve_pair`] renders the same value onto a PAIR
//! socket through [`MonitorEvent::encode`]. The wire form is decided in that
//! one method and nowhere else, so the typed stream and the `inproc://` form
//! cannot disagree about what happened — the same rule the subscription
//! forms follow, where the API form is enqueued once and the session alone
//! turns it into a command.
//!
//! # The wire form
//!
//! ```text
//! frame 1: event id, 2 octets, little endian
//!          value,    4 octets, little endian
//! frame 2: the endpoint, as text
//! frame 3: the reason, as text        (this library's addition, see below)
//! ```
//!
//! The first two frames are libzmq's `zmq_event_t` as it reaches the wire:
//! the struct is copied into the frame, so the octet order is the host's,
//! which on every platform this library runs on is little endian. A reader
//! written against libzmq reads those two frames and stops.
//!
//! **The third frame is a named addition, because of a named loss.** libzmq
//! puts a C `errno`, a reconnect interval or a `ZMQ_PROTOCOL_ERROR_*` code
//! in the four-octet value field. This library's errors are named rather
//! than numbered ([`crate::Error`]), so for a failure the value field
//! carries zero and the reason travels as a third frame — additive, the same
//! convention [`crate::zap`]'s `X-Local-Principal` frame uses, and invisible
//! to a two-frame reader. `ZMQ_EVENT_CONNECT_RETRIED` does carry its
//! interval in milliseconds, because that is a number and not an errno.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! `ZMQ_EVENT_PIPES_STATS` and the `zmq_socket_monitor_versioned` family are
//! DRAFT in libzmq and absent here, which
//! [`crate::optiontable`]'s reasoning covers: a draft event no peer can rely
//! on is not an event this library invents a rendering for.
