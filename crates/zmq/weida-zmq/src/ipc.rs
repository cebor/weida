//! The `ipc` transport: `AF_UNIX`, its bind hygiene, and the kernel's answer
//! to *who is on the other end*.
//!
//! A filesystem endpoint is not a port. Every hazard that follows from that
//! has a documented answer, and the answers are not ZeroMQ's — they are the
//! same for any protocol with an `ipc://`-style transport, which is why they
//! live in `weida-runtime`'s [`BoundUnixSocket`] and
//! [`weida_runtime::peer_credentials`] and are used here
//! rather than written again
//! ([0010](../../../docs/decisions/0010-local-transport.md) §4.5,
//! `docs/research/ipc.md` §1.2, §1.5, §7).
//!
//! # Two path budgets, and which one applies where
//!
//! - **The endpoint string** is bounded by [`crate::MAX_IPC_ENDPOINT_BYTES`] where
//!   it is parsed: libzmq publishes "on Linux, the maximum is 113 characters
//!   including the `ipc://` prefix" (`zmq_ipc(7)`,
//!   `docs/research/zeromq.md` §11), and this library refuses at the same
//!   character so that a program ported from libzmq fails where it always
//!   did.
//! - **The path** is bounded by the kernel, at
//!   [`weida_core::MAX_SOCKET_PATH_BYTES`] — 107 bytes on Linux and 104 on
//!   macOS, `sun_path` minus its terminator — and that is checked by
//!   `BoundUnixSocket::bind`, because it is the number the kernel actually
//!   truncates at.
//!
//! On Linux the two coincide (107 + `"ipc://"`.len() == 113), which is why
//! libzmq's published number is really the kernel's. On macOS they do not:
//! `sun_path` is shorter there, so an endpoint that libzmq's documented limit
//! admits can still be refused by the bind, with the platform's own number in
//! the message. Both checks are kept rather than the stricter one alone,
//! because they answer different questions — "is this the endpoint libzmq
//! would have accepted" and "will the kernel store this path without
//! truncating it".
//!
//! # The endpoint-stealing hazard, stated rather than papered over
//!
//! `zmq_ipc(7)`: "if a second process binds to an endpoint already bound by a
//! process, this will succeed and the first process will lose its binding. In
//! this behaviour, the `ipc` transport is not consistent with the `tcp` or
//! `inproc` transports" (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §8). This library has the
//! same behaviour, for the same reason: the stale-node problem has no answer
//! other than unlink-then-bind — a socket file outlives the process that
//! created it, so a crash would otherwise make the endpoint permanently
//! unbindable — and an unlink cannot distinguish a stale node from a live
//! one.
//!
//! What is done about it, and what is not:
//!
//! - **Only a socket is unlinked.** Anything else at the path is refused
//!   (`EADDRINUSE`), because a bind that deletes a caller's file is worse
//!   than a bind that fails.
//! - **The mode is `0600`, set after bind**, never inherited from `umask`.
//! - **The node is removed on drop**, so the common case never meets the
//!   stale node at all.
//! - **The directory is load-bearing and this library cannot fix it.** The
//!   substitution race between unlink and bind is closed only "unless
//!   directory ownership and permissions prevent endpoint substitution"
//!   (`docs/research/ipc.md` §1.2, §7). A caller putting a socket in a
//!   world-writable directory — `/tmp` — can have its endpoint stolen or
//!   substituted by any local user, and no check inside the process can
//!   prevent it. Put the socket in a directory you own and nobody else may
//!   write.
//! - **A stolen endpoint is a broken endpoint for both.** After a steal the
//!   node belongs to the thief, and whichever binding is dropped first
//!   removes it — the loser's unlink takes the winner's socket file with it.
//!   libzmq unlinks on unbind too and has the same consequence; it is stated
//!   here because it is the part a reader would not guess from "the first
//!   process will lose its binding". What the loser keeps is its accepted
//!   connections, which are sockets and not names.
//! - **`inproc://` is the transport without this hazard**, which is exactly
//!   what §8's "not consistent with the `tcp` or `inproc` transports" says.
//!
//! # Credentials, not identity
//!
//! `SO_PEERCRED`/`LOCAL_PEERCRED` is captured once, when the connection is
//! made, and kept on the peer as a [`LocalPrincipal`]. It is the kernel's
//! statement about the process at the other end, which is why it can be
//! trusted at all, and it is *not* re-read per message: the values are a
//! snapshot of the peer as it was when the socket was created
//! (`docs/research/ipc.md` §1.5).
//!
//! Nothing in this crate authorizes anything with it yet. It is captured here
//! because the authorization slice needs it: libzmq's own
//! `ZMQ_IPC_FILTER_UID`/`_GID`/`_PID` did precisely this filtering and are
//! deprecated in favour of ZAP (`docs/research/zeromq.md` §10), so the
//! kernel's answer belongs on the peer and the decision belongs to a handler.
//! It is available as [`crate::Peer::credentials`].
