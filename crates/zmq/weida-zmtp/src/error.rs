//! Why a greeting, a frame, a command or a piece of Z85 was rejected.
//!
//! Four types, split by the layer that produces them, because the layers
//! disagree about what "not enough bytes" means:
//!
//! * a **greeting** is 64 octets read once per connection, and a short read is
//!   normal;
//! * a **frame header** is decoded from a byte stream, so incompleteness is
//!   expected and is not a protocol violation;
//! * a **command body** is decoded from an already-complete frame body, where a
//!   field that runs off the end is a violation and never a request for more
//!   bytes. [`CommandError`] speaks for NULL and PLAIN, [`CurveError`] for
//!   CURVE, whose commands are fixed-size or have a minimum size and whose
//!   names collide with the other mechanisms';
//! * [`Z85Error`] is not a wire error at all: it is a key or a printable blob
//!   that a human or a configuration file got wrong, and it has no
//!   connection to close.
//!
//! Every wire type answers [`is_violation`](FrameError::is_violation): true
//! means close the connection, which is the only remedy ZMTP defines
//! ([37/ZMTP](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/37/), "Error Handling").
