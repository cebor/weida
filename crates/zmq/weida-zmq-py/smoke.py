"""B-058's round trip, run against an installed wheel.

What `package.sh` runs inside a fresh virtualenv with no Rust toolchain on
`PATH`: the item's own proof — an asyncio REQ/REP exchange between two sockets
of this module — plus the metadata a registry needs, read back from the
installed distribution rather than from the source tree.
