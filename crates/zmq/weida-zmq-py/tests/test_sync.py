"""The synchronous surface, and the zguide's Lazy Pirate written on it.

B-116. `weida_zmq.sync` is `weida-zmq`'s own `blocking` facade with Python
argument conversion around it, so a Python program needs no event loop at all.
Nothing about a pattern is implemented twice, which is why the assertions here
are about the *guarantee* rather than about the plumbing:

Lazy Pirate's claim (zguide chapter 4) is that a client which times out,
retries and eventually gives up either gets **the reply to its own request**
or abandons the exchange — never a stale reply to an earlier one, and never a
hang. That is what the recipe below asserts, on a server that deliberately
drops the first requests.

The GIL is released while a call blocks, which the threaded test proves: a
second thread runs while the first is parked in `recv`.
