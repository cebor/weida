"""`sock.split()`: sending while another coroutine is parked in a receive.

B-177's proof. Without a split, every operation on one socket object queues
behind the one in front, because the binding leases the socket to one call at
a time (`weida_zmq.sockets`' module documentation). A DEALER waiting for a
reply therefore could not send the next request until the reply arrived, and
pyzmq lets it. `split()` hands out two halves onto the same connections, and
the tests here are what says they run at the same time:

* `test_dealer_sends_while_recv_is_parked` parks a receive first, checks it
  is still pending, and then sends and completes a full round trip on the
  other half. Before the split the send could not even start.
* the retirement tests pin what happens to the object that was split, in
  both directions: its methods raise `ENOTSOCK`, and splitting twice is the
  same refusal rather than a second pair of halves.

Every coroutine runs under a wall-clock bound, so a binding that deadlocks
fails instead of hanging (docs/LOOP.md 2).
