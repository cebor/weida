"""Sending and receiving: the asyncio surface of all eleven socket types.

B-112. What is asserted here beyond "a message crossed":

* a `Multipart` is one value, sent and received atomically — all frames or
  none, which is 37/ZMTP's rule and not an accident of this binding;
* `send_nowait`/`recv_nowait` are `ZMQ_DONTWAIT`, so they report `EAGAIN`
  rather than waiting;
* a `timeout` argument bounds one call, and expiring is `EAGAIN`;
* a cancelled `asyncio.Task` waiting in `recv` leaves the socket **usable**,
  which is proved by receiving the next message on that same socket rather
  than by the absence of an exception.
