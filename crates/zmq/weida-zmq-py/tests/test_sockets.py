"""The module, the context and the eleven socket types, from Python.

B-058's proof is the first test here: an asyncio REQ/REP round trip between two
sockets of this module, over each of the three transports the library
implements. The rest assert what the item asks for beside it — the three
context constructors, the endpoint surface of all eleven socket types, and
failures arriving as exception classes that carry libzmq's errno name rather
than as one `RuntimeError`.

Every test runs its coroutine under a wall-clock bound, so a binding that
deadlocks fails the suite instead of hanging it (docs/LOOP.md 2).
