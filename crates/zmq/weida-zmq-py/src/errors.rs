//! libzmq's errno vocabulary, as this module's exception classes.
//!
//! `weida_zmq.EAGAIN`, `weida_zmq.EFSM`, `weida_zmq.ETERM` and sixteen more,
//! each its own class under `weida_zmq.ZmqError`, each instance carrying
//! `errno` and `cause`. A caller writes the branch the zguide's recipes are
//! made of — `except EAGAIN` for a timeout, `except EFSM` for a REQ socket out
//! of step — instead of matching on the text of a `RuntimeError`.
//!
//! **The table cannot drift.** [`name_of`] is a `match` over
//! [`weida_zmq::Error`] written by the same macro that writes the name list,
//! so a variant added to the library that is not added here is a compile
//! error in this file rather than an errno that silently arrives as the base
//! class.
