//! Sending and receiving, once, for whichever socket types have them.
//!
//! Eleven socket types do not have eleven sends. They have four shapes, and
//! `zmq_socket(3)`'s "action in mute state" column is what tells them apart:
//!
//! | Shape | Socket types | What a full queue does |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`Transmit`] | REQ, DEALER, PUSH, PAIR | Blocks, bounded by `ZMQ_SNDTIMEO`; never discards. |
//! | [`Report`] | REP, ROUTER | Drops, and says so — the drop is the return value. |
//! | [`Publish`] | PUB, XPUB, XSUB | Fans out to the matching subscribers, dropping for any whose queue is full. A publisher never blocks. |
//! | [`Receive`] | everything except PUB and PUSH | Blocks, bounded by `ZMQ_RCVTIMEO`. |
//!
//! Each shape is a trait here and a generic function over it, so the eleven
//! Python classes are eleven one-line delegations rather than eleven
//! implementations that could disagree. **No protocol behaviour is decided in
//! this file**: the mute actions, REQ's alternation, ROUTER's routing table
//! and the timeouts are `weida-zmq`'s, called rather than re-derived.
//!
//! # `_nowait` is synchronous, and that is not a shortcut
//!
//! `ZMQ_DONTWAIT` means "do not wait", so `send_nowait` and `recv_nowait` are
//! ordinary Python methods rather than coroutines: there is nothing to await,
//! the library's `try_send`/`try_recv` do not touch the reactor, and making
//! them coroutines would add a loop round trip to the one operation whose
//! entire point is not to have one. They report `EAGAIN` when the socket is
//! busy with another coroutine's operation, which is the same answer as a full
//! queue and for the same reason: this call was told not to wait.
