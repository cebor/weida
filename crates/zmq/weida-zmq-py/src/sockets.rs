//! The eleven stable socket types, one Python class each.
//!
//! libzmq has one `Socket` type and a constant to say what it is; this module
//! has eleven classes, because the patterns are not interchangeable and a type
//! error at construction beats `ENOTSUP` at the first send. It is the shape
//! `weida-zmq` already has in Rust, carried across unchanged: a PUB has no
//! `recv` here because a PUB cannot receive, rather than having one that
//! always fails.
//!
//! Every class gets the endpoint surface every socket has, and then whichever
//! of [`ops`](crate::ops)'s four shapes its pattern is — which is why the
//! class list below reads as a table of capabilities and why no socket type
//! has an implementation of its own here.
//!
//! # One operation at a time, per socket object
//!
//! A `weida-zmq` socket handle is `Send` and **not** `Sync`: libzmq's
//! "applications MUST NOT use a socket from multiple threads" expressed as a
//! type. So each socket here lives in a [`Slot`](crate::lease::Slot) and
//! every call leases it for as long as the operation runs. Two coroutines
//! that use one socket therefore *queue*; they do not interleave and they do
//! not race.
//!
//! The consequence is worth stating plainly rather than discovering: a task
//! parked in `await sock.recv()` holds the socket, so a concurrent
//! `await sock.send(...)` on that same object waits for the receive to finish
//! or to be cancelled. `recv_nowait` and `send_nowait` report `EAGAIN`
//! instead of queueing, because they were told not to wait.
//!
//! Where the two directions of a socket type are independent, that is not the
//! only option: `await sock.split()` hands out a sending and a receiving half
//! onto the same connections, usable from two coroutines at once
//! ([`crate::halves`]). DEALER, ROUTER, PAIR, XPUB and XSUB have it; REQ and
//! REP do not, because 28/REQREP's alternation is one sequence. Otherwise:
//! two sockets, which is what the patterns are for, or one coroutine owning
//! the socket.
//!
//! # Why every awaiting call is a coroutine
//!
//! Even the calls `weida-zmq` answers synchronously (`connect`, `unbind`,
//! `last_endpoint`, `close`) are `await`ed here. They need the socket, the
//! socket may be held by a parked receive, and a *synchronous* Python method
//! that waited for it would block the event-loop thread itself — the one thing
//! an asyncio library must never do. Awaiting costs a coroutine; blocking the
//! loop costs the program. The two `_nowait` methods are the exception, and
//! they are exempt precisely because they never wait for anything.
