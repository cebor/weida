//! `zmq_socket_monitor`, twice over: an async iterator and the `inproc` PAIR.
//!
//! One publisher, two renderings, and the octets decided in exactly one place
//! — `weida_zmq::monitor` — which is why neither of these is a second
//! implementation of anything:
//!
//! * **As an async iterator.** `async for event in socket.monitor():` hands
//!   the application typed events, so a Python program that wants to know
//!   about a reconnect does not have to decode a two-frame message first.
//! * **As the `inproc://` PAIR.** `await monitor.serve_pair(pair)` writes the
//!   same events onto a PAIR socket in libzmq's two-frame form, which is what
//!   the zguide's Espresso recipe reads and what a port from C expects.
//!
//! # Why the end of the stream is `StopAsyncIteration`
//!
//! A monitor ends when its socket is gone, which the library reports as
//! `ENOTSOCK`. For an `async for` that is not an error, it is the end of the
//! iteration, so this module turns exactly that one errno into Python's
//! `StopAsyncIteration` — and nothing else, so a lagging monitor
//! (`EAGAIN`, events dropped) still arrives as the exception it is.
