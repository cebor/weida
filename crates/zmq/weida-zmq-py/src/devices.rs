//! `zmq_proxy` and `zmq_proxy_steerable`, over the sockets of this module.
//!
//! The loop itself is `weida_zmq::proxy`: both directions, one message at a
//! time, a capture socket that gets a copy of every message, and
//! PAUSE/RESUME/TERMINATE/STATISTICS on a control socket. **None of it is
//! written twice** — this module's whole job is to get a Python socket object
//! into that function.
//!
//! # Why the type erasure
//!
//! `weida_zmq::Device` is a trait with `async fn` methods, and `proxy` is
//! generic over three or four of them. A Python caller chooses the socket
//! types at runtime — `proxy(xsub, xpub, capture)` — so a generic
//! instantiation per combination would be eleven cubed of them. An `async fn`
//! in a trait is not dyn-compatible either, so the erasure is done here, once:
//! [`ErasedDevice`] boxes the two futures, [`Erased`] implements
//! `weida_zmq::Device` over that box, and `proxy` is instantiated exactly
//! once with `Erased` in every position.
//!
//! The erasure costs one `Box` per message per side. The alternative — a
//! proxy loop written in this crate — would be a second implementation of the
//! device, which [0013](../../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md)
//! §4.4 forbids for the reason a reader can guess: the two would disagree
//! exactly where no test looked.
