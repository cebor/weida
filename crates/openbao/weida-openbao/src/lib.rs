//! OpenBao (and Vault) for weida
//! ([decisions/0032](../../../docs/decisions/0032-identity-sources-and-the-handoff.md)).
//!
//! Three things, in the order a process needs them:
//!
//! 1. **A client** ([`OpenBao`]) that authenticates one of three ways
//!    ([`Auth`]): a token it was given, an AppRole login, or a **hand-off** —
//!    a response-wrapping token minted by a controller, redeemed exactly once
//!    and before anything else, whose failure to redeem means somebody else
//!    already did ([`Error::HandoffStolen`], 0032 §2). The client keeps its
//!    token renewed for as long as it lives.
//! 2. **An identity signed by a PKI mount** ([`PkiSign`]): the key stays
//!    local, a CSR over it is signed by a role, and the certificate is
//!    renewed under the **same key** — so weida's fingerprint, and the
//!    redial of [0031](../../../docs/decisions/0031-transparent-redial-and-the-sender-outbox.md)
//!    that pins it, survive every rotation. `pki/issue`, which would rotate
//!    the key, is deliberately not offered.
//! 3. **Trust anchored on the mount's CA** ([`PkiAnchor`]) and **material
//!    read from KV** ([`Kv`]), for the peers and the deployments that need
//!    them.
//!
//! What this crate does not do: check revocation (no CRL, no OCSP; the TTL
//! is the answer, and the renewal is what makes a short one affordable),
//! and mint the controller's wrapped token (a `bao` invocation in a unit
//! file, see `examples/handoff`).
