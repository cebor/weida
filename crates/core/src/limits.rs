//! Master doc §50: no internal queue may be unbounded, and every allocation
//! that a remote peer can influence must have a defensive ceiling. Each field
//! below names the remote-controlled quantity it bounds.
//!
//! **`Limits` is a per-connection profile.** Every field applies to one
//! connection — which is what a runtime holding one profile per connection
//! tier will need
//! (`docs/decisions/0002-control-and-bulk-separation.md` §6.4). Numbers that
//! belong to a runtime rather than to a connection — how many connections a
//! binding accepts, how many one peer may hold, how deep an endpoint's queue
//! is, how many resolved addresses a dial tries — live on `RuntimeConfig`
//! instead, so that no profile can carry a value nothing reads.
