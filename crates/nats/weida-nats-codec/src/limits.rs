//! The caller's bounds, passed to every decode, and the numbers the server
//! documentation defaults them to.
//!
//! NATS declares its sizes in ASCII on the control line: `PUB x 18446744073709551615`
//! is twenty-six octets that announce sixteen exabytes, and `MSG` can do the
//! same in the other direction. A decoder that believed a declared count
//! before checking it would be killed by a control line that fits in a single
//! read. So the payload bound is an **argument**, not a constant, and it is
//! checked from the control line alone — before the payload is looked at and
//! before anything is reserved.
//!
//! The bound is an argument for a second reason as well: the real value is
//! remote configuration. The server announces its own ceiling in
//! `INFO.max_payload` ("Maximum payload size, in bytes, that the server will
//! accept from the client"), so a client learns it at connect time and cannot
//! know it before. [`DEFAULT_MAX_PAYLOAD`] is the server documentation's
//! default for that setting, offered as a starting value — never used as the
//! cap by this crate, which has no way to reach for it.
//!
//! Four numbers, because a peer has four ways to make a decoder commit
//! memory: a declared payload count, a control line that never ends, a header
//! block with unboundedly many entries, and a `connect_urls` array naming
//! unboundedly many servers. Only the first of the four is length-prefixed;
//! the other three are counted as they are walked.
