//! Why a control line, a header block or a JSON object was rejected.
//!
//! Two types, split by the direction that produces them, because the
//! directions disagree about what "not enough bytes" means.
//!
//! * [`DecodeError`] comes from bytes a peer sent. Exactly one of its
//!   variants — [`DecodeError::Incomplete`] — is *not* a protocol violation:
//!   a control line or a payload may be split across reads, and asking for
//!   more octets is the normal answer. Everything else is a violation, and
//!   [`DecodeError::is_violation`] says so, because the remedy differs: read
//!   again versus drop the connection. NATS has no in-band way to reject one
//!   operation and keep the connection — the server's own answer to a line it
//!   cannot parse is `-ERR 'Parser Error'` followed by a close, so a client
//!   that cannot parse the server's line has nothing softer available either.
//! * [`EncodeError`] comes from our own side, and every variant is a value
//!   the wire cannot carry: a subject with a space in it, which the peer
//!   would read as two arguments; a `-ERR` reason containing the quote that
//!   delimits it; a header name with a colon in it. There is no "incomplete"
//!   on the way out.
//!
//! The vocabulary is shared between the control line, the header block and
//! the JSON scanner, so a rule the decoder enforces is a rule the encoder
//! cannot break either.
