//! The narrow JSON reader against arbitrary bytes, through both objects that
//! use it.
//!
//! `INFO` arrives from a server that a client has not authenticated yet, so
//! its JSON is the earliest untrusted input in the protocol — earlier than
//! any subject or payload. The reader is hand-written and must not have a
//! panic, an unbounded array or an unbounded recursion in it.
//!
//! Properties: reading never panics; `connect_urls` never exceeds the cap; a
//! `CONNECT` that reads back writes an object that reads to the same fields
//! and encodes to the same octets.
