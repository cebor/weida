//! A whole stream of operations, decoded the way a reader does it.
//!
//! The single-operation target cannot see the framing bug that matters most:
//! a decoder that reported the wrong number of octets consumed, or that found
//! a payload's `CRLF` instead of its own, would still decode each operation
//! in isolation and would still round trip. It is only when the next
//! operation is read from `input[used..]` that the error shows up — as a
//! sudden violation in the middle of a stream that was legal so far.
//!
//! Properties: every operation in the stream consumes at least one octet and
//! at most what is left; the stream ends in `Incomplete` or in a violation,
//! never in an infinite loop; re-encoding the whole stream and reading it
//! back yields the same sequence of operations.
