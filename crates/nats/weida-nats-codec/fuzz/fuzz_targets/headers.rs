//! The `NATS/1.0` header block against arbitrary bytes.
//!
//! Properties: decoding never panics; an accepted block holds no more entries
//! than the cap; `encoded_len` is exactly what `encode` writes — the two
//! disagreeing would put a wrong `#header bytes` on an `HPUB` control line
//! and split the receiver's payload at the wrong offset; and an accepted
//! block re-encodes to something that decodes to the same block.
//!
//! A header block is length-delimited by the control line, so unlike an
//! operation it can never be "incomplete": every error here is a violation.
