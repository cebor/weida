//! One operation against arbitrary bytes.
//!
//! Properties: decoding never panics; an accepted operation's payload is
//! exactly as long as the count its control line declared and is inside the
//! cap; an accepted operation re-encodes, and the re-encoding decodes to the
//! same value with the same octets.
//!
//! The cap is deliberately far below the server's documented 1 MiB default,
//! because a NATS control line declares its payload in ASCII: twenty-six
//! octets can announce sixteen exabytes, and a decoder that trusted the
//! number would be killed by the fuzzer's memory limit rather than caught by
//! an assertion.
