//! The connection: `INFO`, `CONNECT`, TLS, the pings, and the driver that
//! owns the wire.
//!
//! ```text
//! TCP connect
//!       <---------------------- INFO {...}        unprompted, and first
//!   [TLS handshake, where INFO.tls_required or the caller asked for it]
//! CONNECT {...} ------------->                    exactly one credential form
//! PING          ------------->                    so that a refused CONNECT is
//!       <---------------------- PONG              an answer rather than a silence
//! ...
//!       <---------------------- INFO {...}        asynchronous, any time
//! PING/PONG both ways, bounded
//! (no CLOSE verb: ending the transport ends the connection)
//! ```
//!
//! # `INFO` comes first, and it is the server that speaks
//!
//! "The server sends `INFO` after accepting the connection"
//! (`docs/research/nats.md` §1) — before the client says anything at all.
//! That is the opposite of AMQP, where the client's protocol header opens the
//! conversation, and it is load-bearing: the `INFO` carries `max_payload`,
//! `tls_required`, `auth_required`, `headers` and the `nonce`, so **every**
//! decision the `CONNECT` encodes depends on having read it. A client that
//! wrote first would be guessing at all five.
//!
//! # The `CONNECT` is confirmed by a `PING`
//!
//! The protocol has no positive acknowledgement for `CONNECT`. With
//! `verbose: false` a server that accepts it says nothing, and a server that
//! refuses it sends `-ERR 'Authorization Violation'` and closes. So this
//! client writes `CONNECT` and `PING` together and waits for the `PONG`: a
//! `PONG` means the `CONNECT` was read and accepted, an `-ERR` means it was
//! not, and either way the handshake ends in an answer instead of in a
//! connection that looks open and is not. This is what every mainstream NATS
//! client does, for the same reason.
//!
//! # The pings are two clocks and one bound
//!
//! * **Ours to answer.** A server `PING` is answered with `PONG` immediately.
//!   The server's own `ping_interval` (2 minutes) and `max_pings_out` (2) are
//!   its half of the rule (§11): miss enough of them and it disconnects us as
//!   stale.
//! * **Ours to send, and ours to bound.** This client pings on
//!   [`ConnectionOptions::ping_interval`] and counts how many went
//!   unanswered. At [`ConnectionOptions::max_pings_out`] the connection is
//!   reported [`State::Failed`] rather than pinged forever — a client that
//!   kept pinging a server that never answers has replaced a failure with a
//!   silence, and the application would wait on it indefinitely.
//!
//! # Asynchronous `INFO`
//!
//! "A server may send later asynchronous `INFO` messages; a capable client
//! must handle them outside the initial handshake" (§1). This client claims
//! `protocol: 1`, which is the claim that it does. A later `INFO`:
//!
//! * replaces `connect_urls`, retained under
//!   [`ConnectionOptions::max_connect_urls`] and readable through
//!   [`Connection::info`];
//! * raises or lowers `max_payload`, which takes effect on the next publish;
//! * carries `ldm: true` when the server has entered Lame Duck Mode, which
//!   [`Connection::lame_duck_notice`] surfaces as the drain notice it is:
//!   the server is about to stop accepting connections and will drain the
//!   ones it has (§1, §12 P17).
//!
//! # There is no reconnect loop
//!
//! Deliberately, and stated rather than left ambiguous: "client reconnection
//! policy is a client-library policy, not a Core NATS wire guarantee" (§1),
//! and B-165's acceptance does not ask for one. When the connection ends,
//! [`Connection::closed`] reports why and every subscription ends with it —
//! which is the protocol's own behaviour, since "core subscriptions vanish
//! with the connection and have no stored session". The material a policy
//! needs is exposed instead: the failure reason, the retained `connect_urls`,
//! and the lame-duck notice. Redialling, re-subscribing and backing off are
//! the caller's, because only the caller knows whether its subscriptions are
//! still wanted.
