//! Why an operation failed, in the protocol's own vocabulary where it has
//! one.
//!
//! NATS names very few failures itself. What it does name, it names in
//! `-ERR '<reason>'` — `Authorization Violation`, `Stale Connection`,
//! `Maximum Payload Violation`, `Maximum Control Line Exceeded`,
//! `Invalid Subject` — and those are the names used here rather than a second
//! invented set:
//!
//! * [`Error::Server`] carries an `-ERR` reason through unchanged, because the
//!   server's sentence is the only explanation a client is going to get and
//!   folding it into a category would throw it away.
//! * [`Error::StaleConnection`] is the server's own term for a connection
//!   whose pings went unanswered (`-ERR 'Stale Connection'`), used here for
//!   the *client's* side of the same rule — the client counts unanswered
//!   pings too, and calling it anything else would invent a word for a thing
//!   the protocol has already named.
//! * [`Error::PayloadTooLarge`] and [`Error::ControlLineTooLong`] are the
//!   local halves of `Maximum Payload Violation` and `Maximum Control Line
//!   Exceeded`. They are produced *before the wire*: a publish above
//!   `INFO.max_payload` is a publish the server will refuse and then close
//!   on, so refusing it locally costs one comparison and saves the
//!   connection.
//! * [`Error::NoResponders`] is the `NATS/1.0 503` status message, which is a
//!   distinct outcome from [`Error::RequestTimeout`] and must never be
//!   reported as one: 503 means "nobody was listening, now", and a timeout
//!   means "somebody may well have been".
//!
//! Everything else is either the transport, the codec, or a configuration
//! this client refuses to deliver.
