"""One publish/subscribe round trip and one request, against an installed wheel.

What `package.sh` runs inside a fresh virtualenv with no Rust toolchain on
`PATH`: a subscription that receives its publication and a request that gets
its reply, plus the metadata a registry needs, read back from the installed
distribution rather than from the source tree.

The peer is the tests' own scripted server and **not** `nats-server`: the
binary is absent on most machines (B-168 says so and skips), and what this
script has to prove is that the *extension in the wheel* works, not that a
server accepts it. Routing, the 503 and the reply subject all come from
`tests/scripted.py`, which is a server and nothing else.
