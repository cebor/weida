//! The values that cross: a message, a header block, the server's `INFO` and
//! where a connection is.
//!
//! All four are plain data, so both surfaces of this module — the coroutines
//! of `weida_nats` and the blocking calls of `weida_nats.sync` — hand back
//! the *same* classes. A Python program that checks
//! `isinstance(message, weida_nats.Message)` gets the same answer either way,
//! and there is no second `Message` to keep in step.
//!
//! # Octets, not text
//!
//! `subject`, `reply_to` and `payload` are `bytes`, because that is what the
//! library keeps them as and why: the payload is opaque by definition, and a
//! subject is remote input that a conforming server may deliver in any
//! encoding. [`PyMessage::subject_str`] is there for the ordinary case where
//! it is text, and is `None` where it is not — a decode that cannot fail is
//! a decode that lies.
//!
//! Header names and values are `str`, because ADR-4's grammar is HTTP-like
//! text and a client compares them.
