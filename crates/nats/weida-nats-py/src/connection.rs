//! The connection: the handshake, the reactor it runs on, and every
//! operation a Core NATS client has.
//!
//! # Where the reactor comes from
//!
//! [0013](../../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.4 gives
//! a library three ways to reach a reactor, and `weida_zmq.Context` offers
//! all three because all three mean something to a Python process. A NATS
//! connection is not a context — it is one socket with a driver behind it —
//! so the same three are offered where they mean something and are absent
//! where they do not:
//!
//! | Python | Rust | What it is for |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `await weida_nats.connect(host, port)` | `Exec::owned` | The default, and the only one a plain Python program can use: the connection owns a reactor of `worker_threads` threads, and no asyncio loop drives it. |
//! | `await Connection.connect_current(host, port)` | `Exec::current` | The *ambient* Tokio reactor. A plain Python process has none, so this raises `weida_nats.Runtime` — the honest answer rather than a hidden second reactor. It is reachable when this module is imported into a process a Rust host already runs a reactor in. |
//! | `await Connection.connect_sharing(other, host, port)` | `other`'s `Exec`, cloned | A second connection on the first one's reactor, holding the same `OwnedReactor` alive. Two connections to two clusters over one thread pool, which is what a program with several connections wants and what ten `connect` calls would not give it. |
//!
//! There is no fourth, and in particular there is no `Connection()`
//! constructor: connecting reads the server's `INFO` and answers it, so it is
//! a coroutine, and a `__new__` that dialled would be a constructor that
//! blocks an event loop.
//!
//! # What keeps the reactor alive
//!
//! [`Exec::owned`] hands back an `OwnedReactor` beside the handle, and the
//! runtime dies with it. So every object that can still cause work on that
//! runtime holds one — the connection, and each subscription taken from it —
//! rather than the connection alone: a Python program that keeps a
//! subscription and drops the connection object is a program whose messages
//! must keep arriving.
//!
//! # No protocol behaviour lives here
//!
//! Subject validation, `INFO.max_payload`, the inbox, the mandatory request
//! window, the 503-versus-timeout distinction, queue groups and every bound
//! are `weida-nats`'s. This file converts arguments and awaits.
