//! `weida_nats.sync`: Core NATS for a Python program with no event loop.
//!
//! ```python
//! from weida_nats import sync
//!
//! nats = sync.connect("127.0.0.1", 4222)
//! orders = nats.subscribe("orders.>")
//! nats.publish("orders.created", b"{}")
//! print(orders.next_msg(2.0).payload)
//! reply = nats.request("service.echo", b"ping", 2.0)
//! nats.close()
//! ```
//!
//! # It implements nothing, and the `block_on` is here because it has to be
//!
//! `weida-zmq` has a `blocking` module of its own, so `weida_zmq.sync` is
//! that module with argument conversion around it. `weida-nats` has no such
//! facade — B-165 built the asynchronous client and no second surface — so
//! the `block_on` lives here instead. That is the only difference. Every
//! method below drives **the same future the coroutine surface awaits**:
//! subject validation, `INFO.max_payload`, the inbox, the mandatory request
//! window, the 503-versus-timeout distinction, queue groups and every bound
//! are decided once, in `weida-nats`, and this module cannot disagree with
//! `weida_nats` because it does not implement them.
//!
//! # The calling thread drives, and the GIL is released while it does
//!
//! [`futures::executor::block_on`], not the reactor's `block_on`: the
//! reactor's threads are busy driving the connection, and a caller that
//! parked one of them would be waiting for the worker that has to drive what
//! it is waiting for. `weida-runtime`'s contract is that "the caller may
//! drive the returned futures on any executor —
//! `futures::executor::block_on` included", and this is that sentence used:
//! the operation's future is polled on the thread that asked, while the
//! socket and the timers it waits on run on the reactor the connection owns.
//!
//! The one thing [`drive`] does beyond polling is enter the runtime context
//! for the duration, which is not the same as running on it: `tokio::net`
//! and `tokio::time` look for the ambient runtime of the thread that
//! *creates* a socket or a timer, and `weida-nats` creates both inside the
//! future this drives.
//!
//! Each of those calls happens inside [`Python::detach`], so other Python
//! threads run while one is parked in `next_msg`. A blocking binding that
//! held the GIL would make a second thread pointless, and the usual shape of
//! a synchronous messaging program — one thread per subscription — would be
//! a program that runs one subscription at a time.
//!
//! No asyncio loop exists in such a process and none is needed: the reactor
//! belongs to the connection object.
//!
//! # What has no synchronous form
//!
//! `__aiter__` and `__anext__`, because they are asyncio's spelling of a
//! loop; a synchronous caller writes `while (message := sub.next_msg(1.0))`.
//! Everything else on `weida_nats.Connection` and
//! `weida_nats.Subscription` is here under the same name, minus the `await`.
