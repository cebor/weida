//! `weida-nats`'s failure vocabulary, as this module's exception classes.
//!
//! `weida_nats.NoResponders`, `weida_nats.RequestTimeout`,
//! `weida_nats.PayloadTooLarge` and eighteen more, each its own class under
//! `weida_nats.NatsError`, each instance carrying `errno` and `cause`. A
//! caller writes the branch request-reply is made of — `except NoResponders`
//! for "nobody was listening, now", `except RequestTimeout` for "somebody may
//! well have been" — instead of matching on the text of a `RuntimeError`.
//!
//! **The table cannot drift.** [`name_of`] is a `match` over
//! [`weida_nats::Error`] written by the same macro that writes the name list,
//! so a variant added to the library that is not added here is a compile
//! error in this file rather than a failure that silently arrives as the base
//! class. That check is why `weida_nats::Error` is not `#[non_exhaustive]`:
//! a wildcard arm would make the drift invisible.
