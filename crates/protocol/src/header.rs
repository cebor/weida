//! CBOR frame headers.
//!
//! The codecs are written by hand rather than derived. Three reasons:
//!
//! * the strictness rules (duplicate-key rejection, non-uint key rejection,
//!   per-field string caps, depth-limited skipping) are protocol requirements,
//!   not serialization defaults;
//! * the exact byte layout is normative — see the golden vectors in
//!   `docs/PROTOCOL.md` §8 — and a derive macro's field ordering is not a
//!   contract we control;
//! * every decoder here is a hostile-input boundary, so its allocation
//!   behaviour has to be readable.
//!
//! All decode failures are protocol violations that close the connection.
//!
//! **No field of a DATA header is required by the decoder.** A header no longer
//! carries the stream's role, so the decoder cannot know which fields the
//! context demands; `endpoint`-on-initiating-streams is enforced by the
//! transport's dispatch, which does know (`docs/PROTOCOL.md` §6.2).
