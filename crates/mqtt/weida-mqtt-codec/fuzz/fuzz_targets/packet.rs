//! The whole packet decoder against arbitrary bytes, under a small cap.
//!
//! Property: decoding never panics, an accepted packet fits the cap, it
//! reports its own encoded length as the bytes the *encoder* will write, and
//! re-encoding yields something that decodes to the same value.
//!
//! Re-decoding rather than re-encoding is deliberate, and it is the difference
//! between fuzzing a codec and fuzzing a serializer. A peer may send
//! properties in any order and may spell an acknowledgement's all-success tail
//! in two, three or four bytes (3.4.1) [mqtt5 §3]; this codec emits one
//! canonical form. Demanding byte equality with the input would therefore
//! report legal inputs as failures, while demanding *value* equality catches
//! the faults that matter: a field silently dropped, a repeatable property
//! lost by the walker, a payload-list entry skipped, or a length computed
//! differently by `body_len` than by the encoder.
//!
//! The one length relation that does hold is `encoded_len <= used`: the
//! canonical spelling is never longer than the spelling that arrived.
//!
//! The cap stays small so that the allocation bound is exercised rather than
//! described: a declared quarter-gigabyte body over a fifty-byte input must be
//! refused from the fixed header, and a decoder that reserved first would be
//! killed by the memory limit instead of caught here.
