//! Deterministic hostile-input smoke tests for the MQTT codec.
//!
//! The always-on companion to the `cargo fuzz` targets under
//! `crates/mqtt/weida-mqtt-codec/fuzz`: the same properties, driven by a
//! seeded xorshift generator so they run on stable Rust, in `cargo test`, with
//! no nightly toolchain and no corpus. The libFuzzer targets explore far
//! deeper; these make sure the properties are never left unchecked.
//!
//! Four properties, and the first is the one MQTT gives no help with.
//!
//! 1. **An accepted packet never exceeds the cap, and a rejected one allocates
//!    nothing.** A packet may declare 268,435,455 bytes from the Remaining
//!    Length alone (2.1.4) and `Maximum Packet Size` is absent by default,
//!    meaning no limit below that (3.1.2.11.4) [mqtt5 §5]. So the decoder's
//!    cap is the whole defence. The tests assert the first directly and the
//!    second by construction — every input here is a few dozen bytes, so a
//!    decoder that reserved the declared length would abort the test process
//!    rather than fail it.
//! 2. **`Incomplete` is reachable only while bytes are genuinely missing.**
//!    A reader loop that parks on a packet the peer has finished sending is
//!    deadlocked, so once the whole declared packet is present the answer must
//!    be a packet or a violation and never a request for more. This is the
//!    property that caught the property-block and packet-body length cases,
//!    and it is asserted by feeding every decoder its own exact byte count.
//! 3. **Whatever decodes, re-encodes to something that decodes the same.**
//!    Not byte-for-byte: a peer may send properties in any order and may spell
//!    an all-zero PUBACK long or short, while this codec emits one canonical
//!    form [mqtt5 §3]. Re-decoding is the check that survives that.
//! 4. **Progress.** A stream reader fed arbitrary bytes always either consumes
//!    at least one packet or stops, never loops.
