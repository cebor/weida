//! Conformance: the golden test vectors of `docs/adapters/mqtt5.md` §10.1.
//!
//! §10.1 publishes these octets, so an implementation — this one, or a future
//! reimplementation, or a reader checking a broker against the document — MUST
//! encode exactly them and MUST decode them back to exactly these values. The
//! vectors are asserted here through the crate's public surface only: the unit
//! tests beside each module cover the halves, and this file is what makes the
//! published bytes binding.
//!
//! Every accept vector is asserted **in both directions**. Encoding alone
//! would not catch a decoder that is wrong in the same way, which is the
//! failure mode that matters when the other end of the wire is Mosquitto and
//! not us. The rejection vectors are asserted once, on the decoder, because
//! there is nothing to encode: they are bytes a peer may send and this codec
//! must refuse.
//!
//! All twenty-three rows of §10.1 are here: the nineteen that carry bytes are
//! asserted in both directions except row 9, which is the long spelling of
//! row 8 and therefore decode-only, and the four malformed rows are asserted
//! on the decoder alone.
