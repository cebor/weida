"""`weida_mqtt.sync`: MQTT from a Python program with no event loop.

The acceptance line of B-152: "the synchronous Python surface over the same
client, no asyncio loop required in the process and no second implementation
of any protocol behaviour, with a receive timeout where the async surface has
cancellation; B-151's QoS 2 round trip runs unchanged in synchronous form."

`test_the_qos_2_round_trip_runs_unchanged_in_synchronous_form` is the last
clause, and it is deliberately the *same* assertions as
`test_a_qos_2_publish_is_awaited_to_its_pubcomp` in `test_interop.py` with the
`await`s removed — because "unchanged" is the claim and a differently-shaped
test would not be evidence for it.
