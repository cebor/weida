//! `weida_mqtt.sync`: MQTT for a Python program with no event loop.
//!
//! ```python
//! from weida_mqtt import sync
//! import weida_mqtt
//!
//! context = sync.Context()
//! client, deliveries = context.connect("127.0.0.1:1883",
//!                                      weida_mqtt.ConnectOptions("sync-1"))
//! client.subscribe([weida_mqtt.Subscription("room/+", 1)])
//! client.publish(weida_mqtt.Message("room/12", b"21.5", qos=2))
//!
//! # Where the asynchronous surface has cancellation, this has a deadline.
//! delivery = deliveries.recv(timeout=5.0)
//! print(delivery.topic, delivery.payload)
//!
//! client.disconnect()
//! ```
//!
//! # It is a facade over a facade, and implements nothing
//!
//! `weida-mqtt`'s own `blocking` module is the synchronous MQTT: a `block_on`
//! around each of the asynchronous client's methods, with the receive deadline
//! where cancellation would be and **no second implementation of any protocol
//! behaviour**. This module is that module with Python argument conversion
//! around it. The QoS state machines, the session, the send quota, the topic
//! aliases, the keep-alive timer and every refusal are decided once, in the
//! asynchronous client, which is why the synchronous surface cannot disagree
//! with the asynchronous one
//! ([0013](../../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.4
//! item 3, [0014](../../../../docs/decisions/0014-parallel-libraries.md) §2).
//!
//! The classes a caller *passes* are the same objects in both surfaces —
//! `weida_mqtt.Message`, `weida_mqtt.Subscription`, `weida_mqtt.ConnectOptions`
//! — and so are the ones it gets back, `Delivery` and `Completion`. Only the
//! three handles differ, because only they differ: `sync.Context`,
//! `sync.Client` and `sync.Deliveries` block where their asynchronous
//! counterparts return a coroutine.
//!
//! # The GIL is released while blocked
//!
//! Every call here parks the calling thread until the operation finishes, and
//! does so inside [`Python::detach`], so other Python threads run while one is
//! waiting in `recv`. A blocking binding that held the GIL would make a second
//! thread pointless — and the usual shape of a synchronous MQTT program, one
//! thread publishing and one consuming, would be a program that does one at a
//! time.
//!
//! The reactor belongs to the context, so no asyncio loop exists in such a
//! process and none is needed.
