//! MQTT 5.0 for Python, on the Rust implementation.
//!
//! `import weida_mqtt` gets a context, a client, a delivery stream and MQTT's
//! reason codes as exception classes. Underneath is `weida-mqtt` — an MQTT 5.0
//! client with no C library, no `weida` and no `weida-protocol` in it
//! ([0013](../../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4) — and
//! `weida-py-core`, the PyO3 foundation every binding in this workspace shares
//! ([0014](../../../../docs/decisions/0014-parallel-libraries.md) §2).
//!
//! ```python
//! import asyncio
//! import weida_mqtt
//!
//! async def main():
//!     context = weida_mqtt.Context()
//!     options = weida_mqtt.ConnectOptions("sensor-1")
//!     client, events = await context.connect("127.0.0.1:1883", options)
//!
//!     granted = await client.subscribe([weida_mqtt.Subscription("room/+", 2)])
//!     assert granted == [2]                       # one code per filter
//!
//!     done = await client.publish(
//!         weida_mqtt.Message("room/12", b"21.5", qos=2)
//!     )
//!     assert done.kind == "complete"              # the PUBCOMP arrived
//!
//!     async for delivery in events:
//!         print(delivery.topic, delivery.payload, delivery.qos)
//!         break
//!
//!     await client.disconnect()
//!
//! asyncio.run(main())
//! ```
//!
//! # This is a client, and MQTT's topology is asymmetric
//!
//! There is no `weida_mqtt.Broker`, and there will not be one here: retained
//! storage, the session store, subscription routing and the Will's timer all
//! live in the server, and the server is Phase D
//! ([0014](../../../../docs/decisions/0014-parallel-libraries.md) §2). What
//! this module has is everything a client says and reads;
//! `docs/libraries/mqtt.md` §0 draws the line row by row.
//!
//! # Asyncio first
//!
//! Every call is a coroutine, driven on the reactor the context owns; nothing
//! blocks the event loop and nothing holds the GIL while waiting. A cancelled
//! task cancels the Rust future underneath — and for a publish that means the
//! *caller* stops waiting while the exchange, which is session state, survives
//! to be retransmitted on the next connection. That asymmetry is the
//! protocol's and not this binding's.
//!
//! **`weida_mqtt.sync` is the same client without a loop** — see [`sync`],
//! which is a facade over the library's own `blocking` module and implements
//! no protocol behaviour of its own. Its one difference is where it has to be:
//! a receive deadline, because a blocking caller has no task to cancel.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! Every failure is a class of this module, named for the MQTT reason code it
//! carries and derived from `weida_mqtt.MqttError`:
//!
//! ```python
//! try:
//!     await client.publish(weida_mqtt.Message("a", b"x", retain=True))
//! except weida_mqtt.RetainNotSupported as refused:
//!     assert refused.reason_code == 0x9A          # the byte, for a log
//!     assert "retain" in refused.cause.lower()    # the words, for a human
//! ```
//!
//! The refusal above never reaches the wire: the server declared `Retain
//! Available` 0 in CONNACK and the client answers with the code the server
//! *would* have sent. `errors` explains why one class per code rather than one
//! per packet.
//!
//! # Building it
//!
//! `crates/mqtt/weida-mqtt-py/develop.sh` is the whole of it, in the shape
//! `weida-zmq-py`'s is: a `uv`-managed virtualenv under the worktree, `maturin`
//! and `pytest` installed into that virtualenv and nothing into the system
//! interpreter, then `maturin develop` and the Python tests.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! **TLS.** The library has it behind a default-on `tls` feature and this
//! binding turns that feature *off*, because the trust anchors are the
//! caller's `rustls::ClientConfig` and this surface has no way to hand one in
//! from Python. A binding that linked a TLS stack it could not configure would
//! be linking it for nothing. `Client.is_encrypted` is therefore always
//! `False`, and says so rather than being absent.
