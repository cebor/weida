//! MQTT's reason codes, as this module's exception classes.
//!
//! Every acknowledgement in 5.0 carries a reason code, which is the protocol's
//! largest single improvement over 3.1.1 — where "a client learned why a
//! server objected only by watching it close the socket"
//! (`docs/research/mqtt5.md` §1.9). A binding that folded them into
//! `RuntimeError` would throw that away, so each code is its own class:
//!
//! ```text
//! Exception
//!  └── weida_mqtt.MqttError              # `except MqttError` catches all
//!       ├── weida_mqtt.NotAuthorized     # one class per reason-code name
//!       ├── weida_mqtt.QosNotSupported
//!       ├── weida_mqtt.NotConnected      # and per failure that has no code
//!       └── ...
//! ```
//!
//! and every instance carries `errno` (the name), `cause` (why) and
//! `reason_code` — the byte, or `None` where the failure has none. The byte is
//! what a caller logs and the class is what a caller branches on, which is why
//! both are there.
//!
//! **One class per name, not per packet.** `NotAuthorized` is 0x87 in CONNACK,
//! PUBACK, SUBACK, UNSUBACK and DISCONNECT alike, so `except NotAuthorized`
//! catches it wherever it arrived — which is what a caller means by it.
//!
//! **A name is a name, not a packet.** `ProtocolError` is 0x82 and appears in
//! this list once, even though it is both a CONNACK code and a DISCONNECT
//! code — and even though a decode failure in this client also earns it. The
//! foundation refuses a duplicated name at import, which is what caught the
//! first draft of this file listing it twice.
//!
//! **The table cannot drift.** [`connect_name`] and [`disconnect_name`] are
//! exhaustive matches over the codec's own enums, so a code added to the
//! library that is not added here is a compile error in this file rather than
//! a reason code that silently arrives as the base class.
