//! What crosses the boundary: a message out, a delivery in, and the three
//! things that describe a subscription.
//!
//! # Why a delivery is a class and not a dict
//!
//! A dict would need a key per property and a caller would have to remember
//! which keys exist. A class has attributes, so `delivery.subscription_ids`
//! either exists or raises `AttributeError` at the point of the typo rather
//! than returning `None` forever. It is also what makes the asymmetry visible:
//! a [`PyMessage`] has the fields a *publisher* sets and a [`PyDelivery`] has
//! the fields a *subscriber* reads, and the two lists differ — a delivery has
//! `dup` and `packet_id`, which nothing publishes, and a message has `retain`
//! as an instruction where a delivery has it as an observation.
//!
//! # The payload
//!
//! `bytes` in both directions, through `weida_py_core::bytes`, with the one
//! copy each direction forces happening where that module says it does. A
//! `str` is not accepted: MQTT payloads are opaque bytes and the `Payload
//! Format Indicator` is a *hint the publisher sets*, not an encoding the
//! protocol applies (3.3.2.3.2), so a binding that encoded a `str` silently
//! would be inventing one.
