//! The context, the client and the delivery stream.
//!
//! # Three objects and not one
//!
//! `Context` owns the reactor, `Client` is the application's end of one
//! connection, and `Events` is the stream of what arrived on it. They are
//! separate because their lifetimes are: a `Client` dies with its connection,
//! a `Context` outlives many, and an `Events` may be handed to a different
//! coroutine from the one that publishes — which is the shape an MQTT program
//! actually has, one task publishing and one consuming.
//!
//! # The GIL and the event loop
//!
//! Every call is a coroutine. Nothing blocks the event loop and nothing holds
//! the GIL while waiting: `Bridge::awaitable` returns as soon as the future is
//! spawned, the future runs on the reactor the context owns with no Python
//! state in it, and the GIL is taken once when the result is converted. A
//! cancelled `asyncio.Task` drops the Rust future, which for a publish means
//! the caller stops waiting — the exchange itself is session state and
//! survives, which is what makes a reconnect a resumption rather than a loss.
