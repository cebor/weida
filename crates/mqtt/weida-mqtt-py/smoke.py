"""The whole binding in one file, against nothing but itself.

What it proves without a broker: the module imports, every class is there,
every reason-code class exists and carries its byte, the topic matcher is
MQTT's, and a connect to a closed port fails with a **named** class rather
than a hang. `package.sh` runs exactly this from a wheel with no Rust
toolchain on `PATH`, which is what makes "the wheel works" a fact.

The round trip through a broker is `tests/test_interop.py`, which needs one.
