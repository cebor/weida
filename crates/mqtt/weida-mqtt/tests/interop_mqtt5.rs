//! The MQTT-5-only half: everything B-148 could not reach because rumqttd
//! 0.20.0 declares almost nothing.
//!
//! Measured against **rmqtt 0.23.1** on 2026-09-12, rustc 1.98.
//!
//! # Why rmqtt and not Mosquitto
//!
//! The item names Mosquitto, and Mosquitto is a **system package**: on this
//! machine `which mosquitto` is empty and `pacman -Q mosquitto` reports it
//! absent, and installing a system package is outside what this loop may do
//! ([LOOP.md](../../../../docs/LOOP.md) §2). rmqtt is a Rust binary reachable
//! with `cargo install`, it claims full 5.0 support, and - the part that
//! decides it - **it declares its capabilities in CONNACK**, which is the
//! exact gap B-148 left. A broker that declares nothing lets a client observe
//! only success; a broker that declares `Maximum QoS` 1 or `Retain Available`
//! 0 is the only way to reach a refusal path against something real.
//!
//! The Mosquitto commands are kept below so the named broker can be measured
//! where it exists, and any disagreement between the two is worth more than
//! either alone.
//!
//! # Running them
//!
//! ```text
//! # The broker measured here, a Rust binary and no system package:
//! #   note the --locked, which is the opposite of what rumqttd needs
//! cargo install rmqttd --version 0.23.1 --locked
//! rmqttd -f crates/mqtt/weida-mqtt/tests/interop/rmqtt.toml
//!
//! # The broker the item names, where the machine has it:
//! #   Debian/Ubuntu: apt install mosquitto
//! #   Arch:          pacman -S mosquitto
//! #   macOS:         brew install mosquitto
//! # then point the tests at it:
//! #   mosquitto -p 21885 -v
//!
//! cargo test -p weida-mqtt --test interop_mqtt5 -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! `#[ignore]` because a broker is a runtime condition: the file compiles
//! everywhere and runs where port 21885 answers. In the session that wrote it
//! the broker ran under the process supervisor with a TCP `ready` condition
//! on that port and was stopped in the same item.
//!
//! # Measured, not inferred
//!
//! Everything here is what the run observed against rmqtt 0.23.1 configured
//! by `tests/interop/rmqtt.toml`. Where a claim depends on that configuration
//! the test names the setting.
//!
//! **What the CONNACK declares**, which is the whole point of a second
//! broker: `Maximum QoS` 2, `Retain Available` 1, `Receive Maximum` 8,
//! `Maximum Packet Size` 1,048,576, `Topic Alias Maximum` 16, all three
//! subscription-availability flags 1, and `Server Keep Alive` 30 s. Every one
//! of those is a property rumqttd 0.20.0 leaves absent, and absence is the
//! default rather than a statement - so this is the first run in which a
//! client's refusal paths are reachable at all.
//!
//! **Two of them are plugins, not listener settings, and that is a trap.**
//! `Retain Available` and `Shared Subscription Available` come from whether
//! `rmqtt-retainer` and `rmqtt-shared-subscription` are started; with the
//! plugins absent the broker declares **0** for both and this client refuses
//! a retained publish with 0x9A and a shared subscription with 0x9E before
//! the wire. That is correct behaviour on both sides and it looks exactly
//! like a broken test, which is why it is written down here.
//!
//! Measured working, end to end through the broker:
//!
//! * **Shared subscriptions.** Two members of `$share/g1/{topic}` and one
//!   ordinary subscriber beside them; one publication produces **one**
//!   delivery to the group and one to the ordinary subscriber. That count is
//!   the only thing that separates a group from a filter.
//! * **Topic aliases in both directions** against a declared maximum of 16:
//!   the second and third publishes to one topic carry a zero-length Topic
//!   Name and the alias, the broker resolves them, and the subscriber
//!   receives the right topic every time.
//! * **Retain Handling 1**, which B-148's broker could not separate from 0:
//!   the first subscribe to a filter gets the stored value, the second
//!   subscribe of the *same* filter does not, and Retain Handling 2 never
//!   does.
//! * **Session Expiry as a timer**: a 1-second interval is gone after a
//!   1.6-second wait and a 300-second interval is not, which is what makes
//!   the short case a measurement of the timer rather than of the sleep.
//! * **Every PUBLISH property forwarded unaltered and in order**, repeated
//!   User Property keys included ([MQTT-3.3.2-17]), with `Message Expiry
//!   Interval` rewritten downwards as 3.3.2.3.3 permits.
//! * **The server's `Receive Maximum` becomes the send quota** and the
//!   client's own declared ceiling is a *different* number the server does
//!   not overwrite - the distinction one shared field got wrong in B-142,
//!   now measured against a broker that declares 8 while the client declares
//!   200.
//! * **One granted SUBACK code per filter in order**, three filters at three
//!   QoS values, and UNSUBACK's 0x11 `No subscription existed` arriving as a
//!   **success**.
//! * **The availability flags as refusals**: the `restricted` listener
//!   declares `Maximum QoS` 1, and a QoS 2 publish is refused locally with
//!   0x9B while QoS 1 and 0 go through; it declares `Topic Alias Maximum` 0
//!   and no alias is sent, against the same client that aliases happily on
//!   the other listener.
//!
//! # Three disagreements, measured against this version
//!
//! Each is asserted where it happens, so a future version that fixes it
//! fails loudly rather than passing quietly.
//!
//! 1. **A retained message *is* sent to a shared subscription.** 4.8.2 says
//!    it must not be. The shared subscriber receives the stored value at
//!    subscribe time with RETAIN 1.
//! 2. **A Client Identifier takeover closes the transport with no
//!    DISCONNECT.** [MQTT-3.1.4-3] has the server close the older
//!    connection, and 5.0's improvement over 3.1.1 is that it says *why* -
//!    DISCONNECT 0x8E, `Session taken over`. Nothing is sent, so the reason
//!    code 5.0 exists to provide is exactly the thing that is missing, and
//!    what this client owes is to report the close by name rather than hang.
//! 3. **`Retain Available` and `Shared Subscription Available` are global to
//!    the broker rather than per listener**, because they are plugin state.
//!    So the two flags cannot differ between two listeners of one broker,
//!    which is why the refusal half of this file uses `Maximum QoS` and
//!    `Topic Alias Maximum` instead - the two flags that *are* per listener.
//!
//! # What is still unmeasured, named rather than worked around
//!
//! * **AUTH.** Neither broker in this repository offers an
//!   enhanced-authentication mechanism. rmqtt has JWT and HTTP auth plugins,
//!   but both authenticate the CONNECT's User Name and Password rather than
//!   running 4.12's AUTH exchange, so 4.12 stays measured only against the
//!   scripted server of `tls_auth.rs`. That file's `AnswerAuth` acts are a
//!   real exchange against our own codec and not against a foreign one, and
//!   this file says so rather than implying coverage.
//! * **`Response Information`.** Asked for and not offered by either broker,
//!   so `Client::response_topic` returning `None` is measured and the
//!   namespace-joining half is not.
//!
//! # A build fact, and it is the mirror image of rumqttd's
//!
//! `cargo install rmqttd --version 0.23.1` **fails** without `--locked`: the
//! resolver picks a `pulsar` version whose `producer::Message` gained a field,
//! and `rmqtt-bridge-egress-pulsar` does not compile against it. With
//! `--locked` it builds in about 3m40s. rumqttd 0.20.0 is the exact
//! opposite - it builds only *without* `--locked`. Two brokers, two pinning
//! failures, in opposite directions, and both are facts about installing a
//! Rust broker in 2026 rather than about MQTT.
