//! Interop against **rumqttd 0.20.0**, measured on 2026-09-12 on rustc 1.98.
//!
//! Our client on **both** sides of a foreign broker, so publisher and
//! subscriber roles are both ours and the broker is the only thing in the
//! middle that is not.
//!
//! # Running them
//!
//! ```text
//! # The broker is a Rust binary, so no system package is involved:
//! cargo install rumqttd --version 0.20.0
//! rumqttd -c crates/mqtt/weida-mqtt/tests/interop/rumqttd.toml -q &
//! cargo test -p weida-mqtt --test interop_rumqttd -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! `#[ignore]` because a broker is a runtime condition
//! ([LOOP.md](../../../../docs/LOOP.md) §2): the file compiles everywhere and
//! runs where port 21884 answers. In the session that wrote it the broker ran
//! under the process supervisor with a TCP `ready` condition on that port and
//! was stopped in the same item.
//!
//! # Measured, not inferred
//!
//! Every claim below was observed in this run against this version, and four
//! of them contradict what the item's own note expected - which is the point
//! of running it.
//!
//! * **`cargo install rumqttd --version 0.20.0 --locked` does not build on
//!   rustc 1.98.** Its `Cargo.lock` pins a `metrics` version whose registry
//!   accessor fails borrow checking (`E0521`, "borrowed data escapes outside
//!   of closure"). Without `--locked` the resolver picks a newer `metrics`
//!   and it builds in about 30 s. That is why the command above has no
//!   `--locked`; it is a fact about the broker's dependency pins rather than
//!   about either MQTT implementation.
//! * **rumqttd 0.20.0 does speak MQTT 5.** Its own `generate-config` enables
//!   a `[v5.1]` listener by default. The project's README checklist leaves
//!   MQTT 5 unchecked, and the checklist is out of date rather than the
//!   build: the broker accepts a 5.0 CONNECT, answers a 5.0 CONNACK **with
//!   properties**, honours Subscription Identifiers and enforces a Topic
//!   Alias Maximum. The backlog item's premise that this broker is
//!   "3.1.1-compatible" is therefore wrong in this client's favour, and what
//!   remains for B-149 is smaller than expected.
//! * **The CONNACK declares `Topic Alias Maximum` 4096** and nothing else, so
//!   the other §11 defaults apply - `Receive Maximum` 65,535, `Maximum QoS`
//!   2, `Retain Available` 1, `Maximum Packet Size` unlimited, all three
//!   subscription-availability flags 1, no `Server Keep Alive`. Asserted
//!   rather than assumed: absence is only safe if the defaults applied are
//!   the specification's.
//! * **Topic Aliases are exercised**, because of that 4096: this client
//!   established aliases against a real broker and the broker resolved them,
//!   so every delivery reached the application with a Topic Name.
//! * **Subscription Identifiers are reported back** on every delivery the
//!   subscription caused ([MQTT-3.3.4-4]), which no scripted server can
//!   prove.
//! * **QoS 0, 1 and 2 all complete** end to end, with the subscriber's own
//!   acknowledgements answered, and the session survives a reconnect with
//!   Clean Start 0 while Clean Start 1 discards it.
//! * **Retained messages work, including the zero-byte delete**: a subscriber
//!   arriving after the publish receives the stored value with RETAIN 1, and
//!   after the delete a new subscriber receives nothing.
//! * **The Will fires on an abnormal close and not on an orderly one.** The
//!   pairing no scripted server can prove, and the reason this file exists.
//!
//! # Three disagreements, measured against this version
//!
//! Each is recorded where the test asserts it, so a future run that finds it
//! fixed fails loudly rather than passing quietly.
//!
//! 1. **A delivery arrives at the subscription's granted maximum rather than
//!    at the minimum of that and the publish's QoS.** [MQTT-3.8.4-8] makes it
//!    the minimum, so a QoS 0 publish reaching a QoS 2 subscription must
//!    arrive at QoS 0; here it arrives at QoS 2. That is an **upgrade**, which
//!    the specification does not permit in either direction. The pair of
//!    tests is what shows it: the downgrade direction is correct, so the
//!    broker is applying the granted value rather than taking a minimum.
//! 2. **Retain Handling 2 is ignored.** "Do not send retained messages at the
//!    time of the subscribe" (3.8.3.1) still sends them. The option byte does
//!    reach the wire - `retain_will.rs` asserts that against the codec - so
//!    the omission is the broker's.
//! 3. **DISCONNECT 0x04 `DisconnectWithWillMessage` publishes nothing.** The
//!    0x00 half works, so this broker implements "discard the Will" and not
//!    "publish it on request".
//!
//! # What this broker cannot exercise, named rather than worked around
//!
//! * **AUTH**: no enhanced-authentication mechanism is offered, so 4.12 is
//!   unmeasured here and stays B-149's.
//! * **Shared subscriptions and the availability flags**: the broker declares
//!   none of the three flags, so the flags' *refusal* paths cannot be reached;
//!   `shared_subscriptions_strategy` exists in its configuration but a broker
//!   that declares nothing lets a client only observe success.
//! * **Session Expiry as a timer** and **Retain Handling 1**, both of which
//!   need a wall-clock wait or a second subscribe of the same filter to
//!   separate from 0, and both of which belong with the 5.0-only half.
