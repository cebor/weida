//! B-145 on the wire: RETAIN, the zero-byte delete, telling a retained
//! delivery from a live one, and the Will.
//!
//! # What a scripted server can and cannot prove about the Will
//!
//! The Will is **published by the server**, so "the Will fires" is not an
//! observable of this client at all - no client ever sees its own Will. What
//! *is* observable, and what every rule in 3.1.2.5 and 3.14.4 turns on, is
//! **how the connection ended**:
//!
//! * a DISCONNECT with reason code 0x00 - the server "MUST discard the Will
//!   without publishing it" ([MQTT-3.14.4-3]);
//! * a DISCONNECT with 0x04 `DisconnectWithWillMessage` - the server publishes
//!   it anyway, which is the only way a client asks for its own Will;
//! * the transport closing with no DISCONNECT at all - the "abnormal
//!   disconnection" that is the mechanism's entire purpose (3.1.2.5).
//!
//! So these tests assert which of those three the server saw, which is exactly
//! the client's half of the contract. The broker half - that the message
//! actually appears on the Will Topic, and that it does not appear when a new
//! connection to the session arrives inside the Will Delay Interval - is
//! measured against a real broker in B-148 and B-149, because asserting it
//! here would only be asserting our own scripted server.
