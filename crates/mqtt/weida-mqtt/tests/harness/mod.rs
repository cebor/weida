//! A scriptable MQTT 5.0 server, built on the codec, for testing the client.
//!
//! It is faithful on the wire and is deliberately **not** an independent
//! implementation: it shares this workspace's codec, so it proves the client's
//! behaviour and not interoperability. Interoperability is B-148's `rumqttd`
//! run and B-149's Mosquitto run, against implementations that share no code
//! with ours.
//!
//! What it is for is the half of the client's behaviour a real broker cannot
//! be made to exhibit on demand: a CONNACK with one particular availability
//! flag clear, a `Server Keep Alive` that overrides, a PINGREQ deliberately
//! left unanswered, a DISCONNECT with a chosen reason code, a connection
//! dropped mid-exchange so a session has something to resume.
//!
//! It records the **bytes** of everything the client sent, not just the packet
//! types, because some of what the client must get right is inside the packet:
//! a retransmission carries DUP 1 and its original Packet Identifier
//! ([MQTT-3.3.1-1], [MQTT-4.6.0-1]), and asserting that needs the packet.

// The harness is compiled separately into every integration-test binary, and
// no single one of them uses all of it: `connection.rs` never looks inside a
// packet, `session.rs` never needs an idle step. Without this each binary
// reports the other's half as dead.
