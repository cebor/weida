//! The synchronous facade, driven from a thread with no reactor at all.
//!
//! That is the whole claim of `weida_mqtt::blocking`, and it is not something
//! a `#[tokio::test]` can make: those run *inside* a runtime, so a facade that
//! secretly needed one would pass. Every test here is a plain `#[test]`, which
//! is a thread with no ambient reactor, and the context's own is the only one
//! in the process.
//!
//! What is **not** tested here is any protocol behaviour, because the facade
//! decides none: the QoS machines, the session, the refusals and the timers
//! are the asynchronous surface's and are tested against it. What is tested is
//! exactly what the facade adds — that a blocking caller reaches them, that
//! the deadline `recv_timeout` adds works, and that the connection survives
//! its expiry.
