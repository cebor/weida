//! The client half of the session, and the one place retransmission is
//! permitted.
//!
//! MQTT's session is "stateful client/server interaction keyed by Client
//! Identifier, spanning zero or more consecutive connections", and it "lasts
//! as long as the latest Network Connection plus the Session Expiry Interval"
//! (4.1) [mqtt5 §2]. The specification splits the state in two, and this
//! module holds exactly the client's half [mqtt5 §2]:
//!
//! * QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages **sent** but not fully acknowledged;
//! * QoS 2 messages **received** but not fully acknowledged.
//!
//! The server's half — the session's existence, the subscriptions, the queued
//! messages, the Will and the session-end time — is a broker's and is Phase D
//! ([0014](../../../docs/decisions/0014-parallel-libraries.md) §2). Holding
//! the client half is explicitly not being a broker: "a client library may
//! hold the *client half* of a server-side concept where the protocol defines
//! it for a client — an MQTT session with its expiry" [0014 §2].
//!
//! **weida has nothing like this, and that is the point of the type.** "There
//! is no L0 session state. Nothing is retained across a connection… no expiry
//! interval, no session table and no reconnect logic enters the runtime"
//! ([0008](../../../docs/decisions/0008-session-identity.md) §4.5), because "a
//! retained session is remote-controlled state that the stream core has no
//! owner for" ([INVARIANTS.md]). So the state has an owner here — the
//! application holds the [`Session`] and decides how long it lives — rather
//! than being smuggled into a runtime that declined it.
//! `docs/adapters/mqtt5.md` §8 L1 is where that division is written down.
//!
//! # Retransmission, and the one circumstance that permits it
//!
//! "This is the only circumstance where a Client or Server is REQUIRED to
//! resend messages. Clients and Servers MUST NOT resend messages at any other
//! time" ([MQTT-4.4.0-1]) (4.4) [mqtt5 §6]. So [`Session::resend`] exists and
//! nothing else in this crate resends anything: there is no timer, no retry
//! interval and no redelivery budget, and that absence is the behaviour. The
//! ecosystem disagrees loudly — EMQX ships `mqtt.retry_interval` at 30 s, and
//! Paho's Python client republishes after a reconnect even with
//! `clean_session=True`, calls that non-compliant itself, and warns that QoS 2
//! messages can therefore arrive twice [mqtt5 §6] — which is exactly why the
//! rule is worth a test that asserts the *absence* of a retransmission inside
//! a live connection.
//!
//! What is resent, and in what shape (4.4, [MQTT-4.6.0-1]) [mqtt5 §6]:
//!
//! * unacknowledged PUBLISH packets with QoS > 0, **with their original
//!   Packet Identifiers and DUP set to 1**, in the order the originals were
//!   sent;
//! * PUBREL packets not yet answered by PUBCOMP.
//!
//! What is **not** resent, ever: QoS 0 PUBLISH packets; a PUBLISH whose PUBREL
//! has already been sent ([MQTT-4.3.3-6]); a PUBLISH already answered with a
//! code of 0x80 or above ([MQTT-4.4.0-2]); and SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE, which
//! are not in the retransmission list at all.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not session state
//!
//! Two things a reader might expect here are per *connection* and are
//! re-initialised each time, so they live with the connection and not with the
//! session: the send quota and `Receive Maximum`, which are "explicitly not
//! session state" (4.9) [mqtt5 §5], and the Topic Alias mappings, which a
//! receiver "MUST NOT carry across connections" ([MQTT-3.3.2-7]) [mqtt5 §2].
//! [`StoredPublish`] therefore has no `topic_alias` field at all — a stored
//! message keeps its full Topic Name, because the alias it was sent under is
//! meaningless on the next connection.
