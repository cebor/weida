//! The context, the client handle, and the one task that owns the socket.
//!
//! **Three constructors, mirroring `weida-runtime`'s `Exec`.** A protocol
//! library's audience is overwhelmingly synchronous and must not have to stand
//! in a reactor to call it, which is why
//! [0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.4 gives
//! `weida-zmq` a context with three, and this one copies the shape:
//! [`Context::new`] borrows the ambient runtime, [`Context::with_handle`]
//! takes a handle to somebody else's, and [`Context::owned`] creates one the
//! context keeps alive.
//!
//! **One task owns the socket, and the handle is a channel.** Every ordering
//! obligation MQTT states is per connection — PUBACK in receipt order, PUBREC
//! in receipt order, PUBREL in PUBREC-receipt order ([MQTT-4.6.0-2] to
//! [MQTT-4.6.0-4]) [mqtt5 §7] — and the specification says nothing about
//! threads [mqtt5 §2]. A single reader and a single writer make those
//! obligations fall out of the structure instead of being reimposed by a
//! sorter, which is the cheapest correct answer.
//!
//! **The keep-alive timer is the client's own liveness, and both halves of it
//! are bounded.** Keep Alive "bounds the gap from finishing one client packet
//! to starting the next; absent other traffic the client MUST send PINGREQ"
//! ([MQTT-3.1.2-20]), and a server receiving nothing for 1.5 times the
//! interval MUST close ([MQTT-3.1.2-22]) [mqtt5 §1]. So the task sends PINGREQ
//! only when nothing else has been sent within the interval — a client that
//! pinged on a timer regardless would be spending the bandwidth MQTT exists to
//! save. The other half, waiting for the PINGRESP, has **no** specification
//! number at all [mqtt5 §1]; it is
//! [`crate::ConnectOptions::effective_ping_timeout`] here, because an
//! unbounded wait is a hang with a rationale ([LOOP.md] §2).
