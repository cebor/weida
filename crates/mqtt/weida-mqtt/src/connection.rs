//! The wire: one packet at a time in each direction, and the handshake.
//!
//! MQTT's transport requirement is a single "ordered, lossless, stream of
//! bytes" in both directions ([MQTT-4.2-1]) [mqtt5 §12/P18], so every packet
//! of a session interleaves on one connection. The read and write halves are
//! **split** rather than shared, and the reason is not style: a reader that
//! hands out a borrowed packet cannot also be asked to write, so splitting is
//! what lets the event loop answer a PUBLISH while the PUBLISH is still
//! borrowed from the receive buffer — and therefore what lets this client
//! decode without copying the payload out first.
//!
//! **Nothing is read into a buffer sized from a declared length.**
//! The reader grows its buffer by what the socket actually delivered and
//! asks the codec whether a whole packet is present yet; the codec applies
//! `Maximum Packet Size` from the fixed header alone, so a peer that declares
//! 268 MB over a four-byte read is refused before anything is reserved
//! (3.1.2.11.4) [mqtt5 §5].
//!
//! **A partial packet at end of stream is a closed connection, not a
//! malformed one.** The peer is always free to drop the socket — that is what
//! 3.1.1 did for every error [mqtt5 §1] — and reporting it as a protocol fault
//! would put the blame in the wrong place.
