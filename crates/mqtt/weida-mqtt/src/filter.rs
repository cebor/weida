//! Topic Names, Topic Filters, and the matcher the specification's own worked
//! examples define.
//!
//! `/` separates levels, `+` matches exactly one level and MUST occupy a whole
//! level ([MQTT-4.7.1-2]), and `#` matches the parent level and any number of
//! child levels and MUST be last and alone in its level ([MQTT-4.7.1-1])
//! [mqtt5 §4.1]. Matching is "character for character with no normalization"
//! ([MQTT-4.7.3-4]) [mqtt5 §3].
//!
//! # Why a client needs a matcher at all
//!
//! Matching is the *server's* job, so a client that only publishes and
//! subscribes never needs one. Two things make it load-bearing here:
//!
//! * **A filter is refused before it reaches the wire.** A malformed filter
//!   earns a SUBACK 0x8F or a DISCONNECT, and refusing it locally is both
//!   cheaper and more specific than reading a reason code back.
//! * **A client has to tell which of its own subscriptions caused a
//!   delivery.** `Subscription Identifier` answers that when the server sends
//!   one, and it is optional and refusable — `Subscription Identifiers
//!   Available` 0 (3.2.2.3.12) [mqtt5 §11] — so against such a server the
//!   only answer is to match the delivered Topic Name against the filters this
//!   client subscribed with. [`Subscriptions::matching`] is that, and the
//!   matcher is why it can exist.
//!
//! # The `$` rule, which is the one a matcher most easily gets wrong
//!
//! "A server MUST NOT match a filter beginning with a wildcard against a
//! Topic Name beginning with `$`" ([MQTT-4.7.2-1]) [mqtt5 §4.1]. So `#`
//! receives nothing under `$` while `$SYS/#` does, and a client that wants
//! both must subscribe to both. The rule is about the *filter's first
//! character*, not about wildcards anywhere in it: `$SYS/+` is fine.
//!
//! # What this is not
//!
//! It is not weida's matcher, and the two genuinely disagree.
//! [0007](../../../docs/decisions/0007-topic-namespace.md) §5's MQTT row group
//! — reproduced in `docs/adapters/mqtt5.md` §6 — records four differences a
//! forwarder owes, and the two that a reader would otherwise assume away are:
//! weida's separator is `.` rather than `/`, so "an MQTT level containing `.`
//! has no faithful translation and MUST be refused or escaped by the adapter,
//! not silently flattened"; and weida "has no reserved topic prefix: `#`
//! matches `$`-prefixed topics too", so an MQTT-facing adapter must exclude
//! them itself. Nothing in this module translates anything; it implements
//! MQTT's rules, and the translation is a forwarder's to refuse.
