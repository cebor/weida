//! What an application publishes, what it receives, and what a completion
//! actually certifies.
//!
//! # The completion vocabulary, and why it is four values
//!
//! MQTT's delivery protocol is "concerned solely with the delivery of an
//! application message from a single sender to a single receiver" and there is
//! "no end-to-end guarantee from publisher to subscriber" (4.3) [mqtt5 §6]. So
//! [`Completion`] says what the *hop* certified and nothing more, and it has a
//! distinct value per QoS because the three levels certify genuinely different
//! things:
//!
//! * [`Completion::Sent`] — QoS 0. "The message arrives at the receiver either
//!   once or not at all" (4.3.1) [mqtt5 §6]; there is no response, no retry
//!   and no stored state, so the strongest true statement is that the bytes
//!   were handed to the transport.
//! * [`Completion::Acknowledged`] — QoS 1's PUBACK: "transfer of ownership for
//!   that hop, nothing else. Not that a subscriber received the message, not
//!   that it was persisted, not that it was processed" [mqtt5 §6]. The
//!   receiver "does not need to complete delivery of the Application Message
//!   before sending the PUBACK".
//! * [`Completion::Refused`] — a PUBREC of 0x80 or above. The message "counts
//!   as acknowledged and MUST NOT be retransmitted" ([MQTT-4.4.0-2])
//!   [mqtt5 §6]: it is dead with no protocol recourse, which is a different
//!   outcome from either success or a retry and deserves its own value.
//! * [`Completion::Complete`] — QoS 2's PUBCOMP: "publication of QoS 2 message
//!   is complete" (3.7.2.1), meaning the handshake terminated and the
//!   identifier is released — "not that any subscriber saw anything"
//!   [mqtt5 §6].
//!
//! **Durability is certified by none of them.** "No acknowledgement certifies
//! durability": the specification puts the choice on the solution developer
//! and 4.1.1 explicitly contemplates loss [mqtt5 §12/P7]. That is why nothing
//! here is named `Stored`, and why `docs/adapters/mqtt5.md` §9.2 refuses to
//! report a PUBACK as anything of the kind.
//!
//! # Success codes that look like failures
//!
//! `0x10 No matching subscribers` is a **success**, and it is the only
//! in-protocol signal that a message reached nobody — the server "MAY use this
//! Reason Code instead of 0x00" [mqtt5 §12/P16]. [`Completion::is_error`] is
//! the 0x80 comparison (2.4) and nothing more, so a caller that wants to know
//! about 0x10 asks for the code.
