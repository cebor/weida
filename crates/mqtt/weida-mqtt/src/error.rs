//! The client's error vocabulary, in MQTT's own terms.
//!
//! The rule this enum exists to keep is B-141's acceptance in one sentence:
//! **a server DISCONNECT's reason code is surfaced as a named error rather
//! than as a closed socket.** In 3.1.1 a server reported every fault by
//! closing the connection and the client had to guess [mqtt5 §1.9]; 5.0 puts
//! a reason code on the refusal, and a client that threw it away would be
//! back where 3.1.1 was. So [`Error::ServerDisconnected`] and
//! [`Error::ConnectionRefused`] carry the code, and
//! [`Error::Unavailable`] carries the code the *server* would have sent had
//! the packet been allowed to leave.
//!
//! The other rule is that a feature the server declared unavailable is
//! **this client's own error and never reaches the wire**. Each of the five
//! availability flags of 3.2.2.3 has a Protocol Error code — 0x9A, 0x9B,
//! 0x9E, 0xA1, 0xA2 [mqtt5 §11] — and the honest thing is to report exactly
//! that code locally rather than to send the packet and let the server close
//! the connection. [`Feature`] is that mapping.
