//! Every ceiling, named: ours, and the server's own.
//!
//! MQTT's §11 is a table of limits and a list of four resources the protocol
//! does not bound at all [mqtt5 §11]. A client is on the exposed side of two
//! of them, so this module is where "no remote input can cause unbounded
//! memory allocation" ([INVARIANTS.md]) becomes a number with a name and a
//! source.
//!
//! **Three tables grow from what a peer sends, and each one's ceiling is the
//! protocol's own rather than invented here.**
//!
//! | Table | Bounded by | Whose number |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Topic Alias mappings the server may establish toward us | `Topic Alias Maximum` we declare in CONNECT (3.1.2.11.5) | ours, declared |
//! | Topic Alias mappings we may establish toward the server | `Topic Alias Maximum` the server declares in CONNACK (3.2.2.3.8) | the server's, honoured |
//! | Unacknowledged QoS 1 and 2 PUBLISH packets we have in flight | `Receive Maximum` the server declares in CONNACK (3.2.2.3.3) | the server's, honoured |
//! | Unacknowledged QoS 1 and 2 PUBLISH packets the server has in flight toward us | `Receive Maximum` we declare in CONNECT (3.1.2.11.3) | ours, declared |
//!
//! Those four are not policy: "the sender sets an initial send quota, non-zero
//! and not exceeding the peer's Receive Maximum ([MQTT-4.9.0-1])" and "the
//! sender MUST NOT exceed [Topic Alias Maximum] ([MQTT-3.3.2-9])" [mqtt5 §5],
//! so using the peer's declared value *is* the bound, and saying so here is
//! what stops a later reader from inventing a second one beside it.
//!
//! **Two more tables have no protocol ceiling, so [`Limits`] supplies one.**
//! The Subscription Identifiers a single delivery may carry — "a single copy
//! carries all matching identifiers ([MQTT-3.3.4-4])" [mqtt5 §4.1] — are
//! bounded only by the packet size, and the queue of deliveries waiting for
//! the application is bounded by nothing at all. Both get a named field, and
//! both say in their own documentation that the number is ours because the
//! protocol has none.
