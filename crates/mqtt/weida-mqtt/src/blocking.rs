//! **No protocol behaviour is decided twice.** The QoS state machines, the
//! session, the retransmission rule, the send quota, the topic aliases, the
//! keep-alive timer and every refusal are the asynchronous surface's, and this
//! module is a thin wrapper that drives its futures to completion. A
//! synchronous MQTT that re-derived any of them would be a second
//! implementation that could disagree with the first
//! ([0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.4 item 3).
//!
//! # Where the future is polled, and why not on the reactor
//!
//! Not the reactor's `block_on`: the reactor's threads are busy driving the
//! connection, and a caller that parked one of them would be waiting for a
//! worker that is waiting for it. `weida-runtime`'s contract is that "the
//! caller may drive the returned futures on any executor —
//! `futures::executor::block_on` included", and this is that sentence used:
//! the client's future is polled here, on the thread that asked, while the
//! connection task it waits for runs on the reactor. Two threads may
//! therefore each block on their own call.
//!
//! # Cancellation becomes a deadline
//!
//! The asynchronous surface's answer to "wait, but not forever" is to cancel
//! the task; a blocking caller has no task to cancel. So the one place a wait
//! is open-ended — reading the next delivery — takes a deadline instead:
//! [`Deliveries::recv_timeout`]. There is no `publish_timeout`, and the
//! omission is deliberate: a publish that is abandoned mid-exchange is still
//! **session state** on both sides, so a deadline there would return control
//! to the caller while the exchange continued — which is exactly what the
//! asynchronous surface's cancellation does and is honest about, and what a
//! method named `publish_timeout` would not be. A caller who wants that runs
//! the publish on its own thread.
