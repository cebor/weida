//! The byte stream a connection runs on: plain TCP on 1883, TLS on 8883.
//!
//! # What TLS is and is not, here
//!
//! "The MQTT protocol is not trust symmetrical. When using basic
//! authentication, there is no mechanism for the Client to authenticate the
//! Server" (5.4.3) [mqtt5 §10]. TLS is the usual answer to that half, with SNI
//! recommended for a server serving several hostnames - and it is the *only*
//! answer this protocol offers, because MQTT has no server-side credential of
//! its own.
//!
//! What TLS proves is what the transport peer is. It says nothing about who
//! composed a message: an application message that arrives on a TLS
//! connection carries no claim about its publisher, because MQTT has no
//! per-message identity at all ([mqtt5 §12/P14], and `docs/adapters/mqtt5.md`
//! §5 records it as a named loss). So there is no conversion from the TLS peer
//! to any identity type in this crate, and no accessor on a [`crate::Delivery`]
//! that returns one. The same rule the SP adapter holds.
//!
//! # Where the trust anchors are not
//!
//! They are the caller's. `TlsOptions` takes a `rustls::ClientConfig` the
//! application built, because which certificates an application trusts is the
//! application's decision and a messaging library that picked for it is one
//! that cannot be audited. This crate adds the tokio adapter over the rustls
//! already in this workspace's graph and **no second TLS stack and no second
//! cryptographic backend**.
//!
//! `TlsOptions` is named in backticks rather than linked because it exists
//! only with the `tls` feature on, and an intra-doc link to a `cfg`-ed item
//! breaks `cargo doc --no-default-features` — which is a configuration this
//! crate supports and therefore documents.
