//! The unsettled map, and what an outcome proves.
//!
//! A delivery is *unsettled* while either end still holds state for it, and
//! settlement is the act of forgetting: "the state of a delivery at one end
//! becomes irrelevant once that end has settled" (Part 2 §2.6.12). Two
//! properties make the model work and both are asserted here:
//!
//! * **Settlement is one-way.** Once an end has settled it can never unsettle,
//!   and an outcome once published is terminal: "no later frame from the
//!   sender can change it" (Part 2 §2.7.5).
//! * **Settlement is idempotent.** A `disposition` naming a delivery this end
//!   has already forgotten is *not* an error and not an update — it is
//!   nothing. Which is what makes the frame safe to repeat, and is why a lost
//!   disposition needs no recovery protocol.
//!
//! # What each mode proves to an application
//!
//! The settle modes are not about frames, they are about what an application
//! may conclude:
//!
//! | Modes | What the sender knows when `send` returns | Will the peer redeliver? |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `snd-settle-mode=settled` | that the octets were written, and nothing else | unknowable from here: the sender forgot |
//! | `snd-settle-mode=unsettled`, `rcv-settle-mode=first` | nothing yet; the outcome arrives in a `disposition` and is final when it does | no, once `accepted` arrived |
//! | `snd-settle-mode=unsettled`, `rcv-settle-mode=second` | nothing yet; the receiver's outcome is *provisional* until this end settles and the receiver sees it | no, and the receiver also knows this end knows |
//!
//! The third row is the only one that gives both ends the same knowledge, and
//! it costs a round trip in each direction. It is also the row brokers refuse:
//! Artemis answers "The Broker does not currently support ReceiverSettleMode
//! of SECOND" and RabbitMQ lists exactly-once as unsupported, so a client that
//! asked for it and did not read the answering `attach` would believe it had a
//! guarantee it does not have.
//!
//! # Who bounds the map
//!
//! A **receiver's** map is bounded by the protocol: it can only grow by a
//! delivery arriving, and a delivery can only arrive against link credit the
//! receiver itself granted. An application that never settles runs out of
//! credit and the sender stalls, which is the designed behaviour.
//!
//! A **sender's** map has no such bound — the receiver may keep granting
//! credit while settling nothing — so the bound is ours:
//! [`DEFAULT_MAX_UNSETTLED`]. At the bound `send` waits, exactly as it waits
//! for credit, rather than growing a map nobody bounded.
