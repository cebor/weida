//! Link credit: counted in messages, granted only by the receiver.
//!
//! The other half of AMQP's flow control — [`crate::window`] is the session's,
//! counted in `transfer` **frames**. Both must permit a transfer and the
//! specification ties them together nowhere, which is why they are two types
//! here. One unit of `link-credit` permits `delivery-count` to advance by one,
//! that is, one message (Part 2 §2.6.7); because a message may span any number
//! of frames, link credit says nothing about bytes.
//!
//! Decision [0003](../../../../docs/decisions/0003-credit-unit.md) took this
//! vocabulary for weida's own L2 credit, so the words here are the words
//! there: *credit* is permission the **receiver** grants, and the unit is a
//! message.
//!
//! # Four variables, and who owns each
//!
//! | Variable | Only this end may change it |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `delivery-count` | the sender |
//! | `link-credit` | the receiver |
//! | `available` | the sender |
//! | `drain` | the receiver |
//!
//! `delivery-count` is a 32-bit RFC 1982 serial number and not a count: it
//! starts wherever the sender's `attach.initial-delivery-count` said and it
//! wraps. Every comparison here goes through [`crate::window::serial_distance`].
//!
//! # An absolute limit, not an increment
//!
//! What a receiver puts on the wire is `delivery-count` and `link-credit`, and
//! what the sender computes from them is
//!
//! ```text
//! link-credit(sender) = delivery-count(receiver) + link-credit(receiver)
//!                       - delivery-count(sender)
//! ```
//!
//! so the pair communicates an **absolute delivery-limit** rather than a
//! delta. That is the whole design: `flow` frames are idempotent, and a
//! duplicated or reordered grant cannot inflate credit. RabbitMQ states the
//! operational consequence as "link credit is set, not accumulated".
//!
//! A receiver that has not yet seen the sender's `attach` does not know a
//! `delivery-count`, MUST NOT set the field, and the sender then substitutes
//! the `initial-delivery-count` it sent itself.
//!
//! # Zero is a stall, not an error
//!
//! "If the link-credit is less than or equal to zero ... a sender MUST NOT
//! send more messages." Nothing is dropped and nothing disconnects: the sender
//! waits. A freshly attached link starts at `link-credit = 0`, so a sender has
//! no permission to send anything at all until a `flow` arrives — which is why
//! [`Credit::may_send`] is asked before every frame rather than once.
//!
//! # Drain turns "wait for a message" into "wait for an answer"
//!
//! `drain=true` tells the sender to send what it has and then advance
//! `delivery-count` until `link-credit` is zero, reporting the new state. The
//! receiver then learns *unambiguously* whether its credit was spent on a
//! message or consumed by the drain, which is how a get-with-timeout is built:
//! `flow(link-credit=1)`, wait, `flow(drain=true)`, wait for zero.
