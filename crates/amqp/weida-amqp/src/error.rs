//! Why a connection failed, in AMQP's own vocabulary.
//!
//! AMQP names its failures with *error conditions* — symbols such as
//! `amqp:decode-error` and `amqp:connection:framing-error` (Part 2 §2.8.15) —
//! and this enum keeps them rather than inventing a second set. Three of its
//! variants exist only because the protocol's negotiation has failure modes
//! that look alike from the outside and must not:
//!
//! * [`Error::SecurityLayerRequired`] — we asked for bare AMQP and the server
//!   answered with a different protocol-id. Part 2 §2.2 is explicit that
//!   "highest supported version" does not apply to the protocol-id, so a
//!   `%d3` reply to a `%d0` request is not a version mismatch and not a
//!   transport error: it is the server saying a security layer is mandatory,
//!   and a client that retried blind would loop.
//! * [`Error::VersionMismatch`] — the same eight octets carrying a version
//!   the server chose instead. AMQP 0-9-1 shares this port and this prefix,
//!   so `AMQP` followed by `0 0 9 1` lands here and is worth saying plainly.
//! * [`Error::Sasl`] — one of the five outcome codes. `sys-temp` is the one
//!   the specification calls transient while saying nothing about how long to
//!   wait, so the code is reported and the waiting is the caller's.
