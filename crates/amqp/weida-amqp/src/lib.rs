//! An AMQP 1.0 client in Rust, usable with no weida in the picture.
//!
//! This crate is a **product, not an adapter**: it implements the client half
//! of the OASIS Standard of 29 October 2012 for applications that speak AMQP,
//! rather than bridging AMQP into weida. Nothing of weida's protocol is in it
//! and nothing of it is in weida
//! ([0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4, §4.5).
//!
//! What it shares with weida is the machine room: `weida-runtime`'s reactor,
//! resolver and close budget, and `weida-core`'s error vocabulary at the
//! boundary. `[dependencies]` names `weida-runtime`, `weida-core` and
//! `weida-amqp-codec`, and **never** `weida` or `weida-protocol`: an AMQP
//! user must not link quinn and weida's pattern layer to open a TCP
//! connection [0013 §4.2].
//!
//! # Client, not broker
//!
//! A client attaches links to a peer's nodes. AMQP 1.0 "defines no operation
//! to create, configure, enumerate or delete a node", so there is no server
//! to build from the core standard alone
//! ([0014](../../../docs/decisions/0014-parallel-libraries.md) §2). This
//! crate holds the client half of every concept the protocol defines for a
//! client — including the ones a broker also has, such as a terminus's
//! expiry policy — and no node model at all.
//!
//! # What exists so far
//!
//! * [`Connection`] — the whole negotiation: the eight-octet header sent
//!   immediately on connect and the partner's answer read as the *demand* it
//!   is, the SASL dialog, TLS reached either way, `open` on channel 0, the
//!   idle timeout in both directions, and `close` as the last thing ever
//!   written.
//! * [`ConnectionOptions`] — every field of `open` under the name Part 2
//!   §2.7.1 gives it, plus the bounds the protocol does not supply. Three
//!   defaults deliberately differ from the specification's and the table in
//!   [`options`] says which and why.
//! * [`Sasl`] — `ANONYMOUS`, `PLAIN` and `EXTERNAL`, chosen rather than
//!   negotiated, with all five outcome codes distinguished.
//! * [`TlsMode`] — the two ways Part 5 §5.2 reaches TLS, which are not
//!   interchangeable.
//! * [`transport::Wire`] — protocol headers and frames over one buffer, with
//!   the 512-octet pre-negotiation ceiling in force until `open` has been
//!   read.
//!
//! # Rules this crate keeps
//!
//! * **Options are honoured or refused, never silently ignored** [0013 §4.4
//!   item 4]. A configuration this client cannot deliver fails in
//!   [`ConnectionOptions::validate`] or at the constructor, with a message
//!   naming the value — a `TlsMode` set on [`Connection::connect`], a
//!   `max-frame-size` below the 512 both peers MUST accept.
//! * **Three defaults deliberately differ from the specification's** [0013
//!   §4.4 item 5]: `max-frame-size`, `idle-time-out` and `channel-max`. All
//!   three are settable back; none is silent. See [`options`].
//! * **Every remote-influenced table has a named bound.** Where the protocol
//!   supplies one this crate uses it — the session table is bounded by
//!   `channel-max` ([`ConnectionOptions::max_sessions`]) — and where it does
//!   not, the bound is ours and says so:
//!   [`connection::OUTGOING_QUEUE`] for frames queued for the driver,
//!   [`sasl::MAX_ROUNDS`] for the challenge/response loop Part 5 leaves
//!   unbounded, and [`ConnectionOptions::max_resolved_addresses`] for the
//!   resolver's answer.
//! * **Identity types stay apart** [0013 §4.4 item 6]. A SASL identity and
//!   weida's proved `Fingerprint` are different claims about different
//!   things, and no conversion between them exists in this workspace.
//!
//! # Sources
//!
//! Every number and every quoted rule comes from
//! `docs/research/amqp10.md`, which cites the five OASIS parts. Part
//! references in this crate's documentation are to those: Part 1 Types,
//! Part 2 Transport, Part 3 Messaging, Part 4 Transactions, Part 5 Security.
