//! How a connection is configured, and every bound it carries.
//!
//! Each field is a field of `open` under the name Part 2 §2.7.1 gives it, or
//! a local bound the protocol does not supply. The difference matters and is
//! stated per field, because AMQP's own defaults are the least safe part of
//! it: a peer accepting them has agreed to a single frame of four gigabytes,
//! 65536 sessions, 2^32 links per session and a connection that never times
//! out (Part 2 §2.4.5, §2.7.1-2.7.3). Only three limits in the protocol are
//! safe by construction — `incoming-window` and `outgoing-window`, which are
//! mandatory, and `link-credit`, which starts at zero.
//!
//! So this type changes three defaults away from the specification's, and
//! says so:
//!
//! | Field | Specification | Here | Why |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `max_frame_size` | `4294967295` (no limit) | [`DEFAULT_MAX_FRAME_SIZE`] | A four-gigabyte frame is a four-gigabyte allocation on a peer's word |
//! | `idle_time_out` | unset (never) | [`DEFAULT_IDLE_TIME_OUT`] | A connection that never times out holds its resources until the OS notices |
//! | `channel_max` | `65535` | [`DEFAULT_CHANNEL_MAX`] | Each session is a live table entry, and 65536 of them is a number nobody asked for |
//!
//! All three are settable back to the specification's value, and none of them
//! is silent.
