//! A delivery: one message, however many `transfer` frames it took.
//!
//! A delivery is the unit link credit is counted in and the unit a disposition
//! names, and it is *not* a frame. "A single transfer MAY span multiple frames
//! with `more=true` on all but the last" (Part 2 §2.6.14), so what arrives is
//! fragments and what the application wants is the message. The reassembly
//! itself belongs to the codec — [`weida_amqp_codec::message::Reassembly`]
//! bounds the payload by the link's `max-message-size` *before* it appends, so
//! a peer cannot hand a receiver an unbounded message one bounded frame at a
//! time.
//!
//! # The two identities
//!
//! * `delivery-id` is session-scoped and is what a `disposition` names.
//! * `delivery-tag` is up to 32 octets chosen by the sending application, and
//!   is what identifies a delivery across a link that was detached and
//!   re-attached — the unsettled map is keyed on it, not on the id.
//!
//! Both are here because settling needs the first and recovering needs the
//! second.
