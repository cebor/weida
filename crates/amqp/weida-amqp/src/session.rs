//! The session: `begin`, `end`, and the two independently numbered
//! directions.
//!
//! A session "correlates two unidirectional channels into a bidirectional
//! sequential conversation" (Part 2 §2.5), and the word *unidirectional* is
//! the part that catches implementers out. Channels are numbered per
//! direction and the two numbers are unrelated:
//!
//! ```text
//! client                                              broker
//!   begin(remote-channel=null)        -- channel 0 -->
//!                                     <-- channel 4 -- begin(remote-channel=0)
//!   transfer                          -- channel 0 -->
//!                                     <-- channel 4 -- disposition
//! ```
//!
//! So one session here holds *two* channel numbers: the one it writes into
//! every frame it sends, and the one the peer writes into every frame it
//! sends. The answering `begin` is what ties them together — it arrives on
//! the peer's outgoing channel and carries our outgoing channel in
//! `remote-channel` — and until it arrives there is nothing to route incoming
//! frames by.
//!
//! # Channels are allocated lowest-free
//!
//! Part 2 §2.5.1: "implementations are RECOMMENDED always to use the lowest
//! free channel number". Not cosmetic — it keeps the session table dense, and
//! the table is bounded by the *peer's* `channel-max` rather than ours,
//! because that is the number that says what channels the peer will accept.
//!
//! # `end`, and the `DISCARDING` state
//!
//! An orderly `end` is answered with an `end`. An `end` carrying an error is
//! different: the sender "MUST send `end(error=...)` and then silently
//! discard all incoming frames until the partner's `end`"
//! (Part 2 §2.5.4-2.5.5). Discarding is not ignoring — the frames are counted
//! and logged — but nothing in them is acted upon, because the session's
//! state is by definition no longer trustworthy. [`SessionState::Discarding`]
//! is that state, and it exists as a value rather than as a comment so that a
//! test can assert a frame arriving in it changed nothing.
