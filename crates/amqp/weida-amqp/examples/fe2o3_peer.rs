//! A foreign AMQP 1.0 peer, on `fe2o3-amqp`'s acceptor, for one connection.
//!
//! The Python binding's tests (B-170, B-171) have to run against the peer of
//! B-162 rather than against a scripted server of their own: a client checked
//! only against a script is checked against the opinion of whoever wrote the
//! script. `fe2o3-amqp` is a pure-Rust implementation with an `acceptor`, so
//! this needs no broker and no C toolchain - the same reason
//! `tests/interop_fe2o3.rs` is not `#[ignore]`d.
//!
//! It lives here, as an example of the library, because the binding crate is
//! a `cdylib`: a test binary there would be left with undefined Python
//! symbols.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build -p weida-amqp --example fe2o3_peer
//! fe2o3_peer receiver   # accepts one delivery and settles it `accepted`
//! fe2o3_peer sender     # sends one message and waits for its outcome
//! ```
//!
//! The port is chosen by the OS and printed as `PORT <n>` on the first line of
//! stdout, so the caller reads it rather than guessing one. The process then
//! serves exactly one connection and exits.
