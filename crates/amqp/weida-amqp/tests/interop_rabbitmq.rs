//! Interop against RabbitMQ 4.x, under the process supervisor.
//!
//! RabbitMQ 4.x speaks AMQP 1.0 natively on 5672 — 3.x needed a plugin and
//! translated 1.0 into 0-9-1 semantics, 4.x does not — so it is the broker
//! worth measuring against. It is also a package rather than a crate, and this
//! machine does not have it:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ which rabbitmq-server
//! $
//! ```
//!
//! So every test here is `#[ignore]`d with the install command in the reason
//! ([LOOP.md](../../../docs/LOOP.md) §2), and the harness starts and stops the
//! broker itself rather than assuming a running one. Nothing in this file has
//! been observed: `docs/libraries/amqp.md` records the `fe2o3-amqp` column as
//! measured and this one as **not run**, which is the honest state and not a
//! claim of compatibility.
//!
//! What each test would establish is written where the test is, so that
//! running them later is reading rather than guessing.
