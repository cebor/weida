//! Why a value, a frame or a performative was rejected.
//!
//! Two types, split by direction, because the directions disagree about what
//! "not enough bytes" means.
//!
//! * [`DecodeError`] comes from bytes a peer sent. Exactly one of its
//!   variants — [`DecodeError::Incomplete`] — is *not* a protocol violation:
//!   a value may be split across reads, and asking for more octets is the
//!   normal answer. Everything else is a violation, and
//!   [`DecodeError::is_violation`] says so, because the remedy differs: more
//!   reading versus a `close` carrying `amqp:decode-error`.
//! * [`EncodeError`] comes from our own side, and every variant is a bug or a
//!   value the wire cannot carry: a symbol beyond a 32-bit size, a
//!   delivery-tag over 32 octets, a frame beyond the size the partner
//!   negotiated. There is no "incomplete" on the way out.
//!
//! The vocabulary is shared between the type system and the layers above it,
//! so a length rule the decoder enforces is a rule the encoder cannot break
//! either.
