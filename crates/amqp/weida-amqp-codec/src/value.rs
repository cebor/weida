//! The Part 1 type system as one Rust type.
//!
//! [`Value`] is every primitive of Part 1 §1.6 plus the three compound kinds
//! and the described type, and it *borrows*: a `binary`, `string` or `symbol`
//! is a slice of the caller's buffer, so the only allocation on the way in is
//! the `Vec` a list, map or array needs for its elements — and that `Vec` is
//! never reserved before the declared count has been checked against
//! [`Limits::max_elements`](crate::Limits::max_elements).
//!
//! One value, many encodings, one canonical encoding. `uint` has three forms
//! (`0x70`, `0x52`, `0x43`) and a decoder must read all three; an encoder
//! writes the shortest that fits, which is what makes
//! `decode(encode(v)) == v` hold while `encode(decode(bytes)) == bytes` does
//! not. The asymmetry is the specification's, not this crate's: Part 1 says
//! "the AMQP type system ... allows multiple encodings for the same value"
//! and names none of them preferred.
