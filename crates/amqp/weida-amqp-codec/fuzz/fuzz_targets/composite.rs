//! The composite decoder against arbitrary bytes.
//!
//! A composite type is a described `list` read by position, and it is the
//! shape every performative, message section and delivery state arrives in.
//! Properties: the cursor never panics; it never yields more non-null fields
//! than the list header declared; and walking past the declared count
//! terminates with nulls rather than looping or reading past the region.
//!
//! The generator is given a plausible described-type prefix, because a
//! uniformly random first octet is `0x00` one time in 256 and the interesting
//! bugs are all past that point.
