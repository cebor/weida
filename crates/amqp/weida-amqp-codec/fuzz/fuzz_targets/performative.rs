//! The nine performatives against arbitrary bytes, reached directly rather
//! than through a frame.
//!
//! The frame target needs a well-formed eight-octet header before it gets
//! anywhere near a performative, which costs the fuzzer most of its budget.
//! This target hands the bytes to the performative decoder with a plausible
//! descriptor in front, so the field-by-field decoding — mandatory fields,
//! restricted types, trailing-null trimming — is what gets explored.
//!
//! Properties: decoding never panics; an accepted performative re-encodes and
//! decodes back to the same value; the round trip is stable over octets, so a
//! peer's wider encoding of a field becomes this crate's canonical one and
//! then stops changing.
