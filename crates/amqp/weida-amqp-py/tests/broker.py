"""A scripted AMQP 1.0 peer, in Python, for the tests to talk to.

Not a broker: it holds no nodes, creates nothing and remembers nothing beyond
one link. It is the *other end* of the four exchanges the tests need, written
by hand so that the assertions are about what this binding put on the wire.

Why in Python at all, when the Rust tests already script a server: because a
Python test that needs a peer must not need a second process, a broker
install or a Rust test harness it cannot see into. `nats-server` is absent on
this machine and so is RabbitMQ (`docs/libraries/amqp.md` §9), so a hand-rolled
peer is what makes `pytest` prove a round trip at all.

The frame encoder here is deliberately minimal: the eight-octet header, a
described list for the performative, and the few field layouts these tests
need. It is not a codec and must never grow into one — the codec is
`weida-amqp-codec`, checked against the specification's own figures.
