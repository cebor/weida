"""The asyncio surface: what an await means, and who grants credit.

B-170. Three claims, and each test asserts the claim rather than the plumbing:

1. `await send` completes when the **peer has said what happened**, and hands
   back the outcome. Not a boolean, not "the octets left".
2. Nothing arrives before `grant_credit`. Link credit is the receiver's
   instrument and this binding never grants any by itself.
3. AMQP's error conditions are exception classes, so a caller writes
   `except weida_amqp.LinkStolen` instead of matching on text.

The peer is `broker.py`: a hand-written AMQP 1.0 other-end in this directory.
`nats-server` and RabbitMQ are both absent on this machine
(`docs/libraries/amqp.md` §9), so a scripted peer is what makes a Python round
trip provable at all.
