"""The synchronous surface: no event loop in the process at all.

B-171. Two claims:

1. **B-170's send-to-`accepted` runs unchanged in synchronous form.** The same
   call, the same outcome object, the same meaning — because it is the same
   client with the waiting moved.
2. **The GIL is released while a call blocks**, which the threaded test proves:
   a second thread runs while the first is parked in `next_delivery`.

The peer runs in its own thread with its own asyncio loop, because the point
of this surface is that the *client's* thread has none.
