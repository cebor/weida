"""Both surfaces against the peer of B-162: `fe2o3-amqp`, not a script.

B-170 asks for a send awaited to `accepted` and a receive settled from Python
*against that peer*, because a client checked only against a server written by
the same hand is checked against one opinion twice. `fe2o3-amqp` is a pure-Rust
AMQP 1.0 implementation with an `acceptor`, so the peer needs no broker and no
C toolchain - it is a `cargo` example of the library this binding wraps,
`crates/amqp/weida-amqp/examples/fe2o3_peer.rs`.

Where that example has not been built the tests **skip** with the one command
that builds it, in the shape `crates/amqp/weida-amqp/tests/interop_rabbitmq.rs`
uses for an absent broker. `develop.sh` builds it, so a normal run does not
skip.
