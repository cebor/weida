//! The session: the two channel numberings and the window links ride on.
//!
//! A session is not a convenience wrapper over a connection. It carries the
//! **frame** half of AMQP's flow control — the six variables of Part 2 §2.5.6
//! — and every link on it competes for that window, so a Python caller that
//! wants two independent windows begins two sessions. `windows()` reports the
//! six so that a stalled sender can be diagnosed rather than guessed at.
//!
//! # The handle is leased
//!
//! `weida_amqp::Session` needs `&mut self` to read its events, so it lives in
//! a [`Slot`](crate::lease::Slot) and each coroutine leases it for the length
//! of one operation. A cancelled task gives it back; see `lease.rs`.
