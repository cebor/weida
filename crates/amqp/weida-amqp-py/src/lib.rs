//! AMQP 1.0 for Python, on the Rust client rather than on Proton.
//!
//! `import weida_amqp` gets a connection, sessions, links and the
//! specification's own error conditions as exception classes. Underneath is
//! `weida-amqp` — an AMQP 1.0 client with no C library, no `weida` and no
//! `weida-protocol` in it
//! ([0013](../../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4) — and
//! `weida-py-core`, the PyO3 foundation every binding in this workspace shares
//! ([0014](../../../../docs/decisions/0014-parallel-libraries.md) §2).
//!
//! ```python
//! import asyncio
//! import weida_amqp
//!
//! async def main():
//!     connection = await weida_amqp.connect("127.0.0.1", 5672, container_id="app")
//!     session = await connection.begin()
//!
//!     sender = await session.attach("orders", "sender", "/queues/orders")
//!     outcome = await sender.send(b"an order")
//!     assert outcome.name == "accepted"          # what the receiver committed to
//!     assert not outcome.may_be_redelivered
//!
//!     receiver = await session.attach("invoices", "receiver", "/queues/invoices")
//!     await receiver.grant_credit(10)            # nothing arrives before this
//!     async for delivery in receiver:
//!         print(delivery.body(), delivery.application_properties())
//!         await receiver.accept(delivery.delivery_id)
//!         break
//!
//!     await connection.close()
//!
//! asyncio.run(main())
//! ```
//!
//! # Three things this surface insists on
//!
//! * **`await send` returns the delivery's terminal state**, not a boolean.
//!   On an unsettled link the coroutine completes when the peer's
//!   `disposition` has settled the delivery, so the `await` means "the
//!   receiver told me what happened". On a `settled`-mode link it returns
//!   `None`, because nothing is coming and nothing can be concluded — which is
//!   the mode's whole cost, reported rather than hidden.
//! * **Credit is granted explicitly.** `grant_credit(n)` and nothing before
//!   it. AMQP's link credit is the receiver's instrument, and a binding that
//!   granted some behind the caller's back would be choosing its prefetch.
//! * **The answering `attach` is data.** `negotiated()` reports the settle
//!   modes actually in force and the addresses the peer actually created,
//!   because a broker may narrow what was asked for and a caller that did not
//!   look would believe it had a guarantee it does not have.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! Two vocabularies in one family, both under `weida_amqp.AmqpError`: one
//! class per client-side failure (`HandshakeTimeout`, `ConnectionGone`,
//! `Configuration`, ...) and one per error condition the specification names
//! (`LinkStolen`, `SessionWindowViolation`, `ResourceLimitExceeded`, ...). A
//! condition wins where the error carries one, because the condition is the
//! part a program can branch on.
//!
//! ```python
//! try:
//!     await session.attach("orders", "sender", "/queues/nope")
//! except weida_amqp.NotFound as missing:
//!     assert missing.errno == "NotFound"
//! ```
//!
//! `weida_amqp.CONDITIONS` maps each class name to the `amqp:...` symbol it
//! stands for, because a Python name cannot contain a colon and a broker's
//! documentation is written in symbols.
//!
//! # Synchronous
//!
//! `weida_amqp.sync` is the same client with no event loop in the process; see
//! [`sync`]. It implements no protocol behaviour of its own.
//!
//! # What differs from `python-qpid-proton`
//!
//! Row by row in `docs/libraries/amqp-py.md`, this binding's parity document.
//!
//! # Building it
//!
//! `crates/amqp/weida-amqp-py/develop.sh` is the whole of it: a `uv`-managed
//! virtualenv under the worktree, `maturin develop`, then `pytest`. The wheel
//! is `abi3` from CPython 3.9, and `package.sh` proves it runs in a fresh
//! virtualenv with no Rust toolchain on `PATH`.
