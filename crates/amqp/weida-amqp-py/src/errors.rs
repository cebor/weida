//! Two vocabularies, one exception family.
//!
//! AMQP has more to say about a failure than an errno does, and a Python
//! caller needs both halves of it:
//!
//! * **what this client did** — a handshake step that timed out, a
//!   configuration it refused, a peer that spoke a version it does not know.
//!   One class per [`weida_amqp::Error`] variant.
//! * **what the peer said** — an `amqp:...` *error condition*, carried in
//!   `close`, `end`, `detach` or a `rejected` outcome. One class per condition
//!   the specification names, so that `except weida_amqp.LinkStolen` is a
//!   branch a program can write.
//!
//! Both derive from `weida_amqp.AmqpError` and both carry `errno` — the class
//! name — and `cause`. A condition class additionally answers `condition()`
//! with the symbol as it appeared on the wire, because the symbol is what a
//! broker's documentation is written in and a Python name cannot contain a
//! colon.
//!
//! **Neither table can drift.** [`name_of`] is a `match` over
//! [`weida_amqp::Error`] written by the same macro that writes the variant
//! name list, so a variant added to the library and not added here is a
//! compile error in this file. The condition table is generated from the
//! codec's own `condition` constants in the same way, and a test asserts that
//! every constant the codec exports has a class here.
