//! The connection: the handshake, the options, and the reactor underneath.
//!
//! `await weida_amqp.connect(host, port, ...)` is the whole entry point. It
//! returns a `Connection` whose reactor the library owns, so a plain Python
//! process needs no ambient Tokio runtime and no asyncio loop is involved in
//! driving the wire — the loop only awaits the futures the bridge hands it.
//!
//! # One constructor, not three
//!
//! `weida_zmq.Context` offers three, because libzmq's context is a
//! configurable object a program may want on an ambient reactor. AMQP's
//! connection is not: it is a TCP connection with a handshake, and
//! `Connection::connect` takes the `Exec` as an argument. So this module
//! creates the reactor with `Exec::owned` and keeps it alive for as long as
//! the connection object exists. The ambient-runtime form would be reachable
//! only from a Rust host that already runs one, and such a host would use the
//! Rust client rather than the binding.
//!
//! # TLS is the caller's certificates or nothing
//!
//! `connect_tls` is deliberately absent from this surface. The Rust client
//! takes a `rustls::ClientConfig`, because which certificates an application
//! trusts is the application's decision, and there is no way to express one
//! from Python without either inventing a trust policy here or exposing
//! rustls's whole builder. Saying so is better than a `verify=False` that
//! nobody audits: `docs/libraries/amqp.md` records it as the one row this
//! binding does not carry.
