//! The link: credit granted from Python, and a send that returns an outcome.
//!
//! Two things here are the acceptance of B-170 and both are about *what an
//! await means*:
//!
//! * **`await send(...)` returns the delivery's terminal state**, not a
//!   boolean. On an unsettled link the coroutine completes when the peer's
//!   `disposition` has settled the delivery, so `await` means "the receiver
//!   has told me what happened" rather than "the octets left". On a
//!   `settled`-mode link there is no answer coming and `send` says so by
//!   returning `None` — which is the honest report, because the mode's whole
//!   cost is that nothing can be concluded.
//! * **credit is granted explicitly.** A receiver calls `grant_credit(n)` and
//!   nothing arrives before it does. No hidden auto-credit: AMQP's link credit
//!   is the receiver's instrument, and a binding that granted some behind the
//!   caller's back would be deciding its prefetch for it.
//!
//! # The delivery stream is an async iterator
//!
//! `async for delivery in link:` is the receive loop, and it ends with
//! `StopAsyncIteration` when the link detaches — which is what a detached link
//! is: no more deliveries, ever. A caller that needs to know *why* it ended
//! reads `state()` afterwards or catches the condition from `detach()`.
