"""One AMQP 1.0 exchange, run against an installed wheel.

What `package.sh` runs inside a fresh virtualenv with no Rust toolchain on
`PATH`: a settled transfer to a scripted peer and the outcome it committed to,
plus the metadata a registry needs, read back from the installed distribution
rather than from the source tree.

The peer is the tests' own scripted one - the *extension* is what has to come
out of the wheel, not the script that talks to it.
