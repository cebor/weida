"""One REQ/REP round trip on each surface, against an installed wheel.

What `package.sh` runs inside a fresh virtualenv with no Rust toolchain on
`PATH`: a request that reaches a replier and its reply that comes back, once
under asyncio and once through `weida_nng.sync` with no event loop in the
process, plus the metadata a registry needs, read back from the installed
distribution rather than from the source tree.

Both ends are this module. No `pynng` and no NNG C library are installed in
the virtualenv, because what this script has to prove is that the *extension
in the wheel* works, not that a foreign peer accepts it - the interop suite
under `tests/` is where that is measured.
