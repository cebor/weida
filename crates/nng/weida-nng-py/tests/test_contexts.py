"""`nng_ctx` from Python: several transactions over one socket, at once.

"Several requests can be processed in parallel over one socket" is what a
context is for. The claim these tests make is the one that matters to a
caller: two coroutines that each hold their own context overlap, and each
reply finds the context that asked for it — which is not true of the socket's
implicit context, where the second request would have to wait.
