"""Interop: this binding against the NNG C library, in both roles.

The peer is `pynng`, which bundles and builds the NNG C library itself, so
what these tests exercise is the reference implementation on the wire and not
a second copy of this codec agreeing with itself. The version is asserted
below rather than assumed, and it is a *different* build from the one the
Rust interop suite measures (`crates/nng/weida-nng/tests/interop_nng.rs`,
NNG 1.4.0-rc.0 through the `nng` crate) — so between them the library is
measured against two releases of the C implementation.

`pynng` is not a dependency of this package. Where it is absent every test
here is skipped, with the install command in the skip message — the same
place LOOP.md 2 puts one.

Every `pynng` call is blocking, so each one runs in a worker thread through
`asyncio.to_thread`; a blocking C call on the event-loop thread would deadlock
against the coroutine it is waiting for.
