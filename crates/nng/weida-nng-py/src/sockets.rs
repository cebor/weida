//! The eleven SP protocols, one Python class each.
//!
//! NNG has one `nng_socket` handle and a constructor per protocol; this
//! module has eleven classes, because the patterns are not interchangeable
//! and a type error at construction beats `NNG_ENOTSUP` at the first send.
//! It is the shape `weida-nng` already has in Rust, carried across
//! unchanged: a PUB has no `recv` here because a PUB cannot receive, rather
//! than having one that always fails.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! A `weida-nng` socket's `send` and `recv` take `&self` and the socket is
//! `Sync`, so two coroutines may use one socket at the same time and a
//! receive parked on an empty socket does not block a send. That is the
//! difference from this workspace's ZeroMQ binding, where libzmq's thread
//! rule is a `&mut self` and every call leases the socket; SP has no such
//! rule, and the protocols that need one transaction at a time — REQ, REP,
//! SURVEYOR, RESPONDENT — enforce it per **context** with `NNG_ESTATE`,
//! which is the protocol's own answer and is what `Context` objects are
//! for.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! Raw sockets and `nng_device`. Raw mode hands the protocol header to the
//! application, and a Python surface for it would be a byte-slicing API
//! over a header this binding's classes deliberately keep — the library has
//! both in Rust for the programs that build forwarders. What is missing is
//! named here rather than half-offered.
