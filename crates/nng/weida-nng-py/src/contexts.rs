//! `nng_ctx` as a Python object, for the four protocols that have one.
//!
//! "Several requests can be processed in parallel over one socket" is what
//! a context is for (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §4): the socket carries
//! the pipes, and each context carries one transaction's state — its own
//! request or survey id, its own deadline, and its own `NNG_ESTATE` rule.
//! Without them a REQ socket is one transaction at a time, which is the
//! whole reason NNG grew contexts.
//!
//! So they are objects here rather than a flag: `socket.context()` hands
//! out a new one, several coroutines each hold their own, and the
//! transactions overlap. A context dropped by Python is removed from its
//! socket, which is `nng_ctx_close`.
//!
//! REP and RESPONDENT share one class because they share one machine: both
//! receive a message whose body begins with a tag stack, both remember the
//! stack, and both may send only the answer to what they received. The
//! library's `RepCtx` and `RespondentCtx` are one Rust type for the same
//! reason.
