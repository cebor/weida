//! The context: the reactor, the `inproc://` namespace and the socket
//! ceiling.
//!
//! **NNG has no object like this, and that is the point.** `nng_socket` is a
//! value in a process-global table, the I/O threads are NNG's own, and
//! `nng_fini()` tears the library down for everybody. A Rust library cannot
//! own the process, so the three things NNG keeps global — the reactor, the
//! `inproc` namespace and the resource ceiling — are held by an explicit
//! value instead, created three ways
//! ([0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.4): on
//! the ambient reactor ([`Context::new`]), on somebody else's
//! ([`Context::with_handle`]), or on one it owns ([`Context::owned`]), which
//! is what a caller with no reactor at all needs.
//!
//! **This is not `nng_ctx`.** NNG's context is per-transaction protocol
//! state — one request ID and its resend timer, one survey and its deadline
//! (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §2) — and it belongs to a socket, not to
//! a process. Those are the per-protocol context types of the REQ/REP and
//! SURVEYOR/RESPONDENT slices; this type is the container they all run in.
