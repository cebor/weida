//! SURVEYOR and RESPONDENT: a broadcast with a deadline.
//!
//! "A surveyor broadcasts a survey to every respondent, then accepts at
//! most one response per respondent; a respondent may decline by not
//! replying" (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §4). The header is the same
//! 32-bit tag stack REQ/REP uses, with a survey ID in the terminal
//! position (§3), so the answering half is literally
//! [`crate::replier`]'s — RESPONDENT and REP differ in their protocol id
//! and in nothing a replier does.
//!
//! **The deadline starts at send, not at arrival.** "Survey time starts
//! when the survey is sent, not when a particular respondent receives it"
//! (§4). So a slow network spends the same budget a slow respondent does,
//! and there is no way to tell the two apart.
//!
//! **Silence is not failure, and it is not distinguishable from
//! slowness.** "A response after expiry is discarded, which makes
//! nonresponse indistinguishable from a slow, unreachable, or deliberately
//! silent respondent" (§4). A test asserts that equality rather than
//! treating an absent answer as an error: what a surveyor learns at its
//! deadline is how many answers it got, and nothing whatever about who did
//! not answer or why.
//!
//! **At most one response per respondent.** "A surveyor normally expects
//! at most one response from each respondent, but the manual warns that
//! some topologies can duplicate responses. The pattern therefore supports
//! collection within a deadline, not a quorum-certified membership result"
//! (§4). This library collects at most one per pipe and discards a second,
//! which is the "normally" case; a duplicate that arrived through a
//! different pipe is a different pipe and is collected, because from here
//! it is indistinguishable from a second respondent.
