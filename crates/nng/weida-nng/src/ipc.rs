//! The `ipc` transport: `AF_UNIX` with hygiene, and the kernel's word
//! about the peer.
//!
//! `nng_ipc(7)` "can expose OS-derived peer UID, GID, PID, and (where
//! applicable) zone ID; the UID/GID values are described as non-forgeable
//! at connection time" (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §10). NNG exposes
//! them as pipe options; here they arrive on the
//! [`PipeInfo`](crate::PipeInfo) a pipe-add-pre callback is handed, which
//! is where "local authorization logic" belongs — "this is application
//! policy, not SP authorization" (§10).
//!
//! **The PID is an observation, not a credential.** UID and GID are what
//! the kernel attributed to the peer at connection time and cannot be
//! forged; the PID is a number that identified a process *then* and may
//! identify a different one by the time anybody looks it up, so
//! authorizing on it is a time-of-check/time-of-use bug with a friendly
//! face ([0010](../../../docs/decisions/0010-local-transport.md) §4.4). It
//! is carried because a log line wants it and refused as a basis for a
//! decision by saying so here and at
//! [`weida_core::LocalPrincipal`].
//!
//! **The bind hygiene is `weida-runtime`'s and is not re-derived.**
//! [`BoundUnixSocket::bind`](weida_runtime::BoundUnixSocket::bind) does the
//! four things a filesystem endpoint needs — the `sun_path` budget, the
//! socket-type check *before* unlinking anything, unlink-then-bind, and an
//! explicit `0600` set after the bind rather than whatever `umask`
//! allowed — and removes the node when the binding drops. NNG's `ipc://`
//! has every one of those hazards; a caller of this transport inherits the
//! answers.
//!
//! **The directory is load-bearing.** Unlink-then-bind opens a
//! substitution race that only directory ownership and permissions close,
//! so the socket belongs in a directory this process owns and no other
//! user may write. That is a deployment property no library can enforce,
//! and it is said here rather than nowhere.
