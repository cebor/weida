//! What every socket type shares: the engine, the two selection rules, and
//! the timeouts.
//!
//! A socket type is a **protocol over the engine**. The engine dials,
//! listens, reconnects and holds one [`Pipe`] per connection; what a socket
//! type adds is the two decisions each SP protocol makes — *which pipe* a
//! message goes to (round-robin over the ready, every pipe, one named pipe)
//! and *what header* it carries. Both live in the socket type; every bound
//! lives in the queue.
//!
//! **These sockets are `Send + Sync`, and that is NNG's rule rather than a
//! liberty.** libzmq's sockets may not be touched from two threads and
//! `weida-zmq` spells that as `!Sync`; NNG's may — `nng_socket` is a value
//! an application copies and uses from anywhere, and contexts exist
//! precisely so that concurrent work on one socket is ordinary
//! (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §2). So a socket here is `Clone` and
//! shares its engine, like the `nng_socket` value it is modelled on.
//!
//! **A timeout is `NNG_ETIMEDOUT`, not `NNG_EAGAIN`.** NNG distinguishes
//! them: `EAGAIN` is what a non-blocking call reports and `ETIMEDOUT` is
//! what an expired `NNG_OPT_SENDTIMEO` or `NNG_OPT_RECVTIMEO` reports (§5,
//! §8). [`within`] is the one place that mapping is made.
