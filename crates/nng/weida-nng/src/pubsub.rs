//! PUB and SUB: broadcast, and a filter that runs at the receiver.
//!
//! "PUB broadcasts every message to every connected SUB; each SUB filters
//! locally by prefix subscription, so subscriptions do not reduce link
//! bandwidth" (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §4). Those two clauses are
//! the whole pattern, and the second one is the expensive one.
//!
//! **Where the filter is, and what it costs.** "A SUB socket that has
//! subscribed to nothing is still sent every publication and discards each
//! one after inspecting its prefix, and a SUB that subscribes to one prefix
//! receives the others too. A publisher's egress is therefore the message
//! size times the number of connected subscribers regardless of what they
//! asked for, and a subscription is a receiver-side cost saving only" (§4).
//! [`SubSocket::discarded`] is that sentence made countable: it is the
//! number of publications this socket was sent and threw away, and a test
//! asserts it is not zero.
//!
//! **The publisher tests nothing.** [`PubSocket::send`] offers a copy to
//! every pipe without looking at any subscription, because there is nothing
//! to look at: a subscription never leaves the subscriber, and no frame,
//! field or command carries one (§3, §4).
//!
//! **A subscription is a byte prefix of the body**, not a topic field:
//! "PUB/SUB uses the initial bytes of the body as a topic; they are neither
//! a separate wire field nor typed metadata" (§3). An empty subscription
//! admits everything (§4).
//!
//! **A full subscriber queue drops, and which end is a choice.**
//! "`SUB_PREFNEW=true`" — the default — "drops the oldest message by
//! default … or rejects the new one when false" (§4). The choice is
//! [`SocketOptions::sub_prefer_new`](crate::SocketOptions::sub_prefer_new),
//! and it applies to the queue **after** the filter, because a queue that
//! dropped a subscribed message to make room for an unsubscribed one would
//! be applying the policy to traffic the application never asked for.
