//! The endpoint engine: dialers, listeners, pipes and reconnect.
//!
//! This is everything an SP socket does *below* its protocol. "A socket owns
//! zero or more listener and dialer endpoints; endpoints create pipes, which
//! are message-oriented connected streams and commonly map 1:1 to TCP or IPC
//! connections", and "either role may listen, dial, or do both; endpoint
//! direction does not prescribe request/reply or other application role"
//! (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §1). So an [`Engine`] owns the
//! [`Dialer`]s, the [`Listener`]s and one [`Pipe`] per live connection, and
//! the socket types above choose which pipe a message goes to.
//!
//! **A pipe is a connection, not an endpoint.** Unlike ZMTP, where a queue
//! is created when a connection is *initiated* and survives reconnects, an
//! SP pipe exists only while its connection does and "communication over
//! that pipe is then impossible" once it is removed (§1). Nothing can be
//! queued here for a peer that has not arrived.
//!
//! **A synchronous dial waits for the peer's protocol header.** "The
//! synchronous `nng_dial()` returns only after the peer's 8-octet protocol
//! header has arrived, not when the TCP connection is established", and a
//! program that calls it from the thread that must answer a greeting
//! "deadlocks until the socket timeout fires" (§1). [`Engine::dial`] keeps
//! the first half and improves the second: it is `async`, so waiting for the
//! header occupies no thread and the reactor keeps serving every other
//! socket in the process — the deadlock the sheet describes cannot be
//! constructed. It is also bounded, by
//! [`SocketOptions::handshake_timeout`](crate::SocketOptions::handshake_timeout),
//! where NNG waits for its socket timeout.
//!
//! **Every timer goes through `weida-runtime`'s `Exec`**: the reconnect
//! backoff and the handshake deadline. Nothing here calls `tokio::time`.
//!
//! What this module does **not** do is speak SP. A connection is handed to a
//! [`Session`], and the 8-octet header, the pairing check and the 64-bit
//! framing are that session's
//! ([0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §5.2).
