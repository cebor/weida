//! Every NNG option, honoured or refused — and never silently ignored.
//!
//! `nng_options(5)` is a list, and a library that implements some of it
//! and shrugs at the rest is a library whose users cannot tell which is
//! which. So the list is here, in full, as data: each row names the option
//! NNG names, says where it applies, and either names what honours it in
//! this crate or carries the reason it is refused
//! ([0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.4
//! item 4).
//!
//! **A refusal happens at configuration time**, which is the only moment
//! it is useful: [`lookup`] is what a configuration surface consults
//! before it accepts a value, and [`Disposition::Refused`] carries a
//! [`Refusal`] that says which of five things went wrong rather than a
//! bare error.
//!
//! **The table is checked, not decorative.** A test walks every row,
//! asserts that an honoured row names something and a refused row carries
//! a reason, and asserts the names are unique. What it cannot assert is
//! that the *whole* of `nng_options(5)` is present; that is what
//! `docs/libraries/nng.md` is for, and this table is what that document is
//! written from.
