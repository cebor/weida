//! PAIR v0 and PAIR v1: the exclusive pair, with and without a hop count.
//!
//! "PAIR v0: a one-to-one peer relationship; it normally blocks when no
//! peer can receive. v0 has no protocol header and is the interoperable
//! legacy choice. PAIR v1: also one-to-one by default; it adds hop-count
//! loop protection across devices" (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §4).
//! Two protocols with two type ids on the wire — `0x0010` and `0x0011`
//! (§3) — so two socket types, [`Pair0Socket`] and [`Pair1Socket`], which
//! is also how NNG spells them (`nng_pair0_open`, `nng_pair1_open`).
//!
//! **One peer at a time, enforced where NNG enforces it.** "A peer rejects
//! another connection when already actively paired" (§4). That refusal
//! happens at the pipe-add-pre hook, before the pipe enters the socket,
//! and the peer is simply disconnected — SP has no frame that could tell
//! it why (§6).
//!
//! **The hop count, and the disagreement about where it starts.** PAIR v1
//! prefixes the body with one big-endian 32-bit word whose low octet is a
//! hop count. The RFC says the counter is "initialized to one and
//! incremented at each node"; NNG's implementation originates `0` and each
//! receiving node increments (§3). **This library sends NNG's `0`**, which
//! [`weida_sp::pair::INITIAL_HOPS`] holds and
//! [`the wire vector`](Pair1Socket::send) asserts, and it **accepts
//! both** readings on receipt, because the difference is a count and not a
//! format. A peer implements one or the other and neither can be detected
//! from the octets.
//!
//! **`NNG_OPT_MAXTTL` is local and is checked here.** "A forwarder checks
//! its own limit" (§4) and a message past it is "dropped on receipt, the
//! pipe kept, and nothing is sent back: the originator observes only the
//! absence of a reply until its own timeout" (§8). That is what
//! [`Pair1Socket::recv`] does, and [`Pair1Socket::dropped_over_ttl`] is
//! the only trace it leaves, because SP leaves none on the wire.
//!
//! **Polyamorous PAIR is absent, and the manual is the reason.**
//! `nng_pair1_open_poly()` permits several direct peers, addresses them by
//! pipe handle rather than by anything routable, "cannot route through
//! devices", and silently discards for a directed peer that is not there.
//! The manual's own words are that this "deprecated mode should not be
//! chosen for new designs" (§4), so it is not implemented; an application
//! that wants many peers over one socket wants BUS, which is the pattern
//! that means it.
