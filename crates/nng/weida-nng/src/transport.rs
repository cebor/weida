//! The one place this crate knows what a connection is made of.
//!
//! An enum rather than a trait object, for the reason weida's own transport
//! boundary gives (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5): the set of transports is
//! closed, small and decided in this crate, and the payload path must stay a
//! direct call. Above it the SP session is written once and cannot tell
//! which transport carried its octets, which is why the protocol is tested
//! once and runs over all of them.
//!
//! Three of the four this library implements are here — `tcp`, `ipc` and
//! `inproc`; `tls+tcp` is refused at the endpoint until its own slice
//! carries it. A transport whose variant is not yet carried is refused by
//! name rather than accepted and dropped somewhere quieter, because a
//! refusal SP can express is a close and a refusal it cannot is a hang
//! (§6).
