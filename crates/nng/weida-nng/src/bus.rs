//! BUS: one hop, best effort, and nothing else.
//!
//! "Each node sends to every *directly connected* peer; a mesh must
//! therefore be fully connected for all nodes to see a publication. Send
//! is best-effort, nonblocking, and discards when a peer cannot receive;
//! delivery may reach some, all, or none"
//! (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §4).
//!
//! **Fan-out is one hop, not flooding.** "A node must have a direct pipe to
//! receive a given send. Consequently, an application that expects every
//! participant to observe every BUS message must establish a fully
//! connected mesh itself" (§4). `tests/bus.rs` stands up a three-node line
//! and asserts the far node receives nothing, which is that sentence with a
//! failure mode.
//!
//! **A send never blocks and never fails for a peer that cannot take its
//! copy.** The copy is discarded "while the originating send succeeds
//! without blocking" (§4), and [`Broadcast`] is the only trace: SP has no
//! receipt, no refusal frame and no way to tell a sender anything (§6).
//!
//! **The ingress pipe, and why it is in the header.** "A raw BUS receive
//! carries the incoming pipe ID in its sole header element" and "a resend
//! excludes that pipe. This prevents immediate echo in the documented
//! single-socket device arrangement; it does not identify a message
//! globally or prevent a larger forwarding cycle" (§3, §4). A cooked BUS
//! message has no header on the wire, so what
//! [`BusSocket::recv`] puts there is **local metadata**: the pipe the
//! message came in on, in the same four big-endian octets the raw form
//! uses, so that [`BusSocket::send_excluding`] takes the same value either
//! way. Nothing of it is ever sent: a send builds its own message.
