//! The blocking facade: SP for a caller with no executor.
//!
//! Behind the `blocking` feature, which is **not** default. NNG's own API is
//! synchronous — "every `nng` crate call is blocking, `Socket::recv`
//! included" (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §13) — and most of this
//! library's audience has no reactor at all. This module is that API: one
//! wrapper per protocol over a [`Context::owned`] reactor the library owns
//! and the caller never sees.
//!
//! # It is a wrapper, and nothing else
//!
//! Every method here is a `block_on` around the asynchronous socket's own
//! method. **No protocol behaviour is decided twice**: REQ's alternation and
//! its resend timer, the tag stacks, the survey deadline, the full-queue
//! actions, the handshake and the timeouts are the async surface's, and this
//! module cannot disagree with them because it does not implement them. Two
//! SP implementations in one crate would be a bug that only shows up in the
//! one the tests do not cover.
//!
//! What a synchronous caller asks about is handled the same way:
//!
//! * `NNG_OPT_SENDTIMEO` and `NNG_OPT_RECVTIMEO` are
//!   [`SocketOptions::send_timeout`] and
//!   [`recv_timeout`](SocketOptions::recv_timeout), honoured by the socket's
//!   own `send` and `recv` — passed down, never re-interpreted here. They
//!   are what turns a stalled exchange into `NNG_ETIMEDOUT` instead of a
//!   thread parked forever.
//! * `NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK` is `try_send`/`try_recv`, which are already
//!   synchronous on every socket of this crate: no executor is entered,
//!   because there is nothing to wait for.
//!
//! Anything a protocol has beyond sending and receiving — `subscribe`, a
//! surveyor's `survey_time`, a SUB's `discarded` — stays on the asynchronous
//! socket and is reached through [`socket`](ReqSocket::socket), because
//! those calls are synchronous already. The facade adds the blocking forms
//! and nothing more.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use weida_nng::blocking::{BlockingContext, RepSocket};
//!
//! # fn main() -> weida_nng::Result<()> {
//! let context = BlockingContext::new()?;
//! let responder = RepSocket::new(&context)?;
//! responder.listen("tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")?;
//! loop {
//!     let request = responder.recv()?;
//!     println!("Received {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(request.body()));
//!     responder.send(b"World".to_vec())?;
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
