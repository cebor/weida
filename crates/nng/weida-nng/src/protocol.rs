//! One row per SP protocol: what it is on the wire, and what a socket
//! speaking it may do.
//!
//! "A protocol-specific socket implements exactly one SP protocol, has
//! endpoint sets, and can send and/or receive only as that protocol permits"
//! (`docs/research/nanomsg-nng.md` §2). This module is that sentence as a
//! table, and it is the reason the crate has one socket type per SP protocol
//! rather than one handle with a tag: PUB cannot receive and SUB cannot send
//! (§4), which is a compile-time fact wherever the socket types are distinct
//! and a runtime surprise wherever they are not.
//!
//! **The wire half is `weida-sp`'s and is not repeated here.** The 12-bit
//! protocol ID, the 4-bit role and the pairing rule live in
//! [`weida_sp::EndpointType`], which is checked against the SP RFCs in a
//! crate with an empty `[dependencies]`
//! ([0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.3). What
//! this module adds is the half that is a *library's* behaviour and not a
//! format: direction, and whether the protocol holds the per-transaction
//! state an `nng_ctx` is made of.
