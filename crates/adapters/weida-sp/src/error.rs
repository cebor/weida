//! Why a protocol header, a message or a per-protocol header was rejected.
//!
//! Three types, split by the layer that produces them, because the layers
//! disagree about what "not enough bytes" means:
//!
//! * the **protocol header** is 8 octets read once per connection, and a short
//!   read is normal while a wrong octet is fatal - the TCP mapping says the
//!   connection MUST be closed immediately [rfc-tcp §2];
//! * a **message header** is decoded from a byte stream, so incompleteness is
//!   expected and is not a violation;
//! * a **per-protocol header** (the request/survey tag stack, the PAIR v1 hop
//!   count) is decoded from an already-complete message body, where a field
//!   that runs off the end is malformed and never a request for more bytes -
//!   "if the reply is shorter than 32 bits, it is malformed and the endpoint
//!   MUST ignore it" [rfc-reqrep §5].
//!
//! Every type answers `is_violation`. True means the connection is finished:
//! SP has no error frame and no code to carry, so closing is the only remedy
//! it defines [rfc-tcp §2]. `TagError` is the interesting case - a malformed
//! tag stack makes the *message* unusable, and NNG's REP drops the message
//! there but keeps the pipe when the count is merely too high, while it does
//! close the pipe on a truncated tag [nng-src `rep.c`]. Both answers are
//! expressible here, and which one the adapter uses is the adapter's, not the
//! codec's.
