//! CURVE command layouts: `HELLO`, `WELCOME`, `INITIATE`, `READY` and
//! `MESSAGE` of [26/CURVEZMQ] as octets, with every cryptographic box an
//! opaque range.
//!
//! [26/CURVEZMQ]: https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/26/
//!
//! # Why there is no crypto here
//!
//! This crate depends on nothing - see the manifest, whose `[dependencies]`
//! section is empty on purpose. A box is therefore a byte range with a
//! documented length and a documented content, and opening or sealing one is
//! the caller's business: `weida-zmq` takes the one cryptographic dependency
//! and does that work. The split is not tidiness. The layouts are the part
//! that has to match libzmq octet for octet, they are checkable against the
//! specification with a hex dump, and they must stay checkable without
//! anybody having to trust a curve implementation first.
//!
//! What this module does own is every length and every fixed prefix, so that
//! nothing downstream has to rediscover them:
//!
//! ```text
//! hello    = %d5 "HELLO"    version padding client-key short-nonce signature-box
//!            2 + 72 + 32 + 8 + 80, six octets of name          = 200 octets
//! welcome  = %d7 "WELCOME"  long-nonce welcome-box
//!            16 + 144, eight octets of name                    = 168 octets
//! initiate = %d8 "INITIATE" cookie short-nonce initiate-box
//!            96 + 8 + 144*, nine octets of name                = 257+ octets
//! ready    = %d5 "READY"    short-nonce ready-box
//!            8 + 16*, six octets of name                       =  30+ octets
//! message  = %d7 "MESSAGE"  short-nonce message-box
//!            8 + 17*, eight octets of name                     =  33+ octets
//! ```
//!
//! All five travel as **command** frames: a CURVE message is encrypted, so
//! even application data arrives with the COMMAND flag set and the name
//! `MESSAGE`, and [`crate::frame`] is unaware of the difference.
//!
//! # The 72-versus-70 contradiction in the HELLO padding
//!
//! 26/CURVEZMQ disagrees with itself. The ABNF says `hello-padding =
//! 72%x00`; the prose says "An anti-amplification padding field. This SHALL
//! be 70 octets, all zero." Only 72 adds up: the specification's own HELLO
//! total is 200 octets, and 6 + 2 + 72 + 32 + 8 + 80 = 200 while 70 gives
//! 198. **This module implements 72**, in both directions, and refuses a
//! 198-octet `HELLO`. The reasoning and the arithmetic are recorded in
//! `docs/research/zeromq.md` §10, and the vectors are published in
//! `docs/adapters/zmtp.md` §10.1.
//!
//! The practical consequence is worth naming: a peer written from the prose
//! sends 198 octets, every field after the padding is displaced by two, and
//! the `HELLO` is refused as [`CurveError::BadLength`] rather than mistaken
//! for a valid one - which is the good failure, because the alternative is a
//! signature box read two octets out of phase.
//!
//! # Mechanism-dependent names
//!
//! `HELLO`, `WELCOME`, `INITIATE` and `READY` are also PLAIN's or NULL's
//! command names, with completely different bodies. The mechanism is settled
//! by the greeting before any command is read, so the caller knows which
//! decoder to use: [`Command::decode`](crate::Command::decode) for NULL and
//! PLAIN, [`CurveCommand::decode`] for CURVE. Nothing here guesses.
//! `ERROR` is shared verbatim and stays with [`Command`](crate::Command).
