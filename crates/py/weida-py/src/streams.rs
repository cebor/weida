//! The streamed transfer surface: a payload written or read in pieces.
//!
//! Slice 1's calls take a whole payload and a ceiling, which is what a Python
//! object is. This module is the other half, and it exists for the case the
//! ceiling cannot answer: a payload larger than the memory the process has,
//! which is the reason [INVARIANTS.md](../../../../docs/INVARIANTS.md) forbids
//! the core from materializing one.
//!
//! * `await pusher.open()` → [`PyOutgoingStream`]: `write`, then `finish`,
//!   which returns when the peer's **transport** holds every byte.
//! * `await requester.open()` → `(stream, reply)`: the two halves of one
//!   exchange, which are independent streams — so a caller may read the reply
//!   while still writing the request, and a responder may answer before the
//!   request ends. That is not an optimisation: a responder that answers
//!   while receiving has flow control live in both directions, so a client
//!   that wrote everything before reading would stall the responder and
//!   therefore itself.
//! * `await puller.recv_stream()` / `await subscriber.recv_stream()` →
//!   `(stream, meta)`: `read(max)` yields the next piece and `b""` at the
//!   end, so a loop over it is the ordinary shape.
//!
//! Every read still takes a ceiling, because a *piece* is a Python object
//! too. What changes is that the ceiling bounds one piece rather than the
//! payload.
//!
//! Dropping an unfinished outgoing stream resets it, so the peer discards the
//! partial payload instead of waiting for a FIN — the same rule the Rust
//! `OutgoingTransfer` has.
