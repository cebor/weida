//! The cursor surface on the asyncio side, and the level vocabulary both
//! surfaces share (B-243).
//!
//! A cursor is how a **one-way** transfer gets a verdict: a Push has no reply
//! to carry one, so `Accepted`, `Stored` and `Processed` arrive on a stream of
//! their own, after the payload's FIN
//! ([0023](../../../../docs/decisions/0023-completion-is-a-cursor.md)).
//! Two handles, one per direction:
//!
//! * [`PyCursors`] is the **sender's** end — what it ordered, as it arrives.
//! * [`PyReporter`] is the **receiver's** end — what this side has reached.
//!
//! # A level is an integer here, and that is the honest spelling
//!
//! The level space is **open**: values below `weida.APPLICATION_FLOOR` are
//! weida's own ladder and everything at or above it is an application stage
//! the library carries and never interprets (0023 §4.4). The named rungs are
//! module constants — `weida.ACCEPTED`, `weida.STORED`, `weida.REPLICATED`,
//! `weida.PROCESSED`, `weida.TRANSPORT_RECEIPT` — so a caller writes the name
//! and an application writes its own number. An **undefined** value below the
//! floor is a protocol violation rather than a private level, because the
//! reserved range is where a later version of the specification puts its own
//! stages: such a value is `weida.Protocol` here rather than a silent
//! reinterpretation.
//!
//! # Nothing waits on a cursor, and nothing here fails for a transport reason
//!
//! A report is never load-bearing. `Cursors.changed()` returning `None` means
//! "no more cursors are coming" and covers three cases on purpose
//! indistinguishable — the reporter finished, the stream was reset, the
//! connection went away — none of which is a failure. `Reporter.report()` is
//! best effort for the same reason seen from the writing side: a peer that
//! dropped the cursor stream must not fail the application doing the
//! reporting.
