//! PAIR, SURVEY and BUS on the asyncio surface (B-244), and RADIO/DISH
//! (B-292).
//!
//! The three patterns the library gained after this binding was written. They
//! are here rather than in [`crate::endpoints`] because they are a slice of
//! their own, not because they are different in kind: whole payloads, an
//! explicit ceiling on every receive, and no pattern behaviour of their own —
//! the one-peer rule, the survey deadline and the never-yourself rule are
//! `weida`'s ([PATTERNS.md](../../../../docs/PATTERNS.md) §4, §5, §6).
//!
//! What a caller has to know per pattern, and nothing else:
//!
//! - **PAIR** keeps its **first** peer. A second dialler is refused on the
//!   transfer, not on the connection, so the refusal cannot be mistaken for a
//!   network failure — and the first peer keeps working, which is the opposite
//!   of ZeroMQ's PAIR.
//! - **SURVEY** is bounded by the **caller's** deadline. Nothing on the wire
//!   carries it and a respondent never learns it; silence is a number.
//! - **BUS** never delivers a member its own message, and forwards for nobody:
//!   a bus of *n* members is *n* × (*n* − 1) deliveries.
//! - **RADIO/DISH** never waits for a dish: `Radio.segment`, `Segment.write`
//!   and `Radio.datagram` are plain calls, and a dish that falls behind loses
//!   the old segment, never the new one
//!   ([0034](../../../../docs/decisions/0034-late-is-lost.md) §4.6).
