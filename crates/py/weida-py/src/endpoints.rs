//! The four endpoints of slice 1: Req/Rep and Push/Pull.
//!
//! Whole payloads in both directions, because that is what a Python object
//! is. The streaming surface — a payload written or read in pieces — stays on
//! the Rust API and is the second slice; what makes the difference visible
//! here is that **every receive takes a ceiling in bytes**, passed straight
//! to `IncomingTransfer::read_capped`, so a stranger cannot decide how much
//! memory a Python process allocates.
//!
//! Each object holds the runtime it came from, so a program that keeps a
//! `Replier` and drops the `Runtime` object is a program whose requests must
//! keep arriving: the reactor dies with the last handle, not with the first.
//!
//! No pattern behaviour is here. REQ's one-exchange-at-a-time, the dispatch
//! refusals, the receipt's meaning and every limit are `weida`'s
//! ([PATTERNS.md](../../../../docs/PATTERNS.md) §1, §2).
