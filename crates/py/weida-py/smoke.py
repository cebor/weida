"""What the release wheel must do, run from a virtualenv that holds only it.

Not a test suite: the suite is `tests/`, and it runs against an editable
build. This is the wheel's own proof - installed into a fresh virtualenv with
no `cargo`, `rustc` or `maturin` on `PATH` - and it checks the three claims a
wheel can be wrong about: that it imports at all, that the metadata is the
one `pyproject.toml` and the workspace version declare, and that a round trip
over QUIC works with both halves inside this one process.
