"""weida from Python: Req/Rep, Push/Pull, trust and the failure classes.

Both halves of every exchange are this library, so these tests need no
external process at all — which is what makes weida's own binding the
easiest of the six to test.

Every coroutine runs under a wall-clock bound, so a binding that deadlocks
fails the suite instead of hanging it (docs/LOOP.md 2).
