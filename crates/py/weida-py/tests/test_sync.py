"""`weida.sync`: the same patterns with no event loop anywhere (B-205).

No `asyncio.run` in this file, which is the point. The endpoints run on
threads, because that is how a synchronous messaging program is written — and
the GIL is released while a call waits, so the thread that serves and the
thread that requests make progress at the same time.
