"""Cursors from Python: a verdict for a transfer that has no reply (B-243).

Both surfaces are here, because cursors are one subject: the asyncio cases
first, the synchronous one after them. What each case is for:

* a Push producer gets ``Processed`` **without an exchange**, which is the
  whole point of the cursor surface -- a fire-and-forget transfer has no reply
  to carry a verdict, and the receipt it does get is the transport's;
* an **application** level is carried and never interpreted, which is visible
  here in a way it is not in Rust: a level is an integer on this surface, so
  ``weida.APPLICATION_FLOOR + 3`` is an ordinary argument;
* a value the protocol *reserves* is refused rather than reinterpreted;
* ordering nothing hands out nothing, on both ends.
