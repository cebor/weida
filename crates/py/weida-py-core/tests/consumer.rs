//! The throwaway consumer of B-111: a binding that binds nothing.
//!
//! This is a `#[pyclass]` with four methods and no protocol behind it —
//! deliberately, because what is under test is the foundation and not a
//! library. It stands in for `weida-zmq-py` and proves the three things B-111
//! asks for, from Python, through a real asyncio loop:
//!
//! 1. an awaitable completing with a value;
//! 2. an exception arriving as its own class, carrying its errno name;
//! 3. a cancelled `asyncio.Task` cancelling the Rust future — asserted by the
//!    future's own `Drop`, which is the only honest evidence that it was
//!    dropped rather than left running for a result nobody will read.
//!
//! Two more failure modes are asserted here because a bridge that gets them
//! wrong hangs, and [LOOP.md](../../../../docs/LOOP.md) §2 forbids hanging: a
//! panicking Rust future becomes an exception, and awaiting with no running
//! loop fails at the call rather than never completing.
