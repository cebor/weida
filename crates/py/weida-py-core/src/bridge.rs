//! The bridge: a Rust future the caller's asyncio loop can await.
//!
//! # The shape of the problem
//!
//! A library here owns its reactor ([`weida_runtime::Exec`]), and a Python
//! caller owns an event loop. Neither may drive the other: the asyncio loop
//! cannot poll a Tokio future, and a Tokio worker must not block on Python.
//! So the two are joined by the one object asyncio already has for "a result
//! that arrives later from somewhere else" — a `loop.create_future()` —
//! completed through `loop.call_soon_threadsafe`, which is asyncio's only
//! thread-safe entry point.
//!
//! ```text
//! Python thread                    reactor thread
//! ─────────────                    ──────────────
//! sock.recv()        → a coroutine; nothing has happened yet
//! await it
//!   the coroutine starts ─ spawn ─▶ the Rust future runs, no GIL
//!   and awaits the delivery                │
//!   the loop runs other tasks              │ done
//!   ◀── call_soon_threadsafe ───────────────┘ (GIL taken once, briefly)
//!   set_result / set_exception
//! ```
//!
//! The coroutine is the outer layer for two reasons: `asyncio.create_task`
//! and `TaskGroup.create_task` accept a coroutine and refuse a bare future,
//! and a coroutine is what defers the work to the first `await` — see
//! [`Bridge::awaitable`].
//!
//! # Why not `pyo3-async-runtimes`
//!
//! That crate solves the same problem, and solves it the other way round: it
//! owns a Tokio runtime (or is handed the one global runtime through
//! `tokio::runtime::Builder`) and asks the library to use *its* reactor. Every
//! library in this workspace already owns a reactor — that is what
//! [`weida_runtime::Exec`]'s three constructors are for, and the point of
//! [0013](../../../docs/decisions/0013-competitor-libraries.md) §4.2 — and two
//! runtimes in one process, one per binding, is the cost of not saying so. The
//! equivalent named in B-111 is this module: it drives futures on the
//! *library's* `Exec` and adds no runtime of its own.
//!
//! # Cancellation
//!
//! A Python `Task` that is cancelled while awaiting cancels the future it
//! waits on, and a cancelled `asyncio.Future` runs its done-callbacks. This
//! module registers one: it aborts the task driving the Rust future, so the
//! Rust future is **dropped** at its next suspension point. In Rust that *is*
//! cancellation — the `recv` releases the socket it borrowed, the queue keeps
//! the message it had not yet taken, and the socket is usable for the next
//! call. Nothing is swallowed: a binding that ignored the callback would leave
//! a Rust task running for a result no one will read.
//!
//! # Failure modes that are not hangs
//!
//! - **The future panics.** It is polled inside `catch_unwind`, so the panic
//!   becomes a `RuntimeError` on the Python future rather than a task that
//!   dies with nobody awaiting it. A future that panicked and told no one is
//!   the hang [LOOP.md](../../../docs/LOOP.md) §2 forbids.
//! - **The loop is closed** before the result arrives. `call_soon_threadsafe`
//!   raises, and there is nothing left to tell: a closed loop has no task
//!   awaiting anything. The error is dropped deliberately and the reason is
//!   written down here rather than in a comment nobody reads.
//! - **No running loop.** The coroutine's first step asks for one, so a
//!   coroutine created outside a loop and awaited inside one is fine, and one
//!   awaited nowhere never asks. Only `asyncio.run`'s own rules apply.
