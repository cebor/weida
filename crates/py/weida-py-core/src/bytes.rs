//! The payload boundary: what crosses as `bytes`, and what it costs.
//!
//! A messaging library's payload is opaque bytes in both languages, so the
//! boundary is pure plumbing — and the plumbing is where a binding quietly
//! pays for the same bytes three times. The rule
//! [0014](../../../docs/decisions/0014-parallel-libraries.md) §2 sets is: no
//! copy where PyO3 allows none, and the copy *measured* where it does not.
//! Both halves are here.
//!
//! # Where no copy happens
//!
//! Python to Rust, PyO3 hands out a borrow of the interpreter's own buffer:
//! [`PyBytes::as_bytes`](pyo3::types::PyBytesMethods::as_bytes) is a pointer
//! into the `bytes` object, and [`payload`] hands back a
//! [`PyBackedBytes`], which is that borrow plus
//! a reference count — no bytes are touched. A binding that only *reads* a
//! payload (a subscription prefix to match, a key to check, a length to bound)
//! copies nothing at all.
//!
//! # Where exactly one copy happens, and why it is not avoidable
//!
//! - **Python to Rust, when the library takes ownership.** `weida-zmq`'s
//!   `Message` — and every other frame type in this workspace — owns a
//!   `Vec<u8>`, because a frame outlives the call that queued it and is sent by
//!   a reactor thread long after. CPython's allocation cannot become a Rust
//!   one, so [`payload_of`] copies once, straight out of the interpreter's
//!   buffer into the `Vec` the library keeps. Not twice: no intermediate
//!   `PyBackedBytes`, no `to_vec` of a `to_vec`.
//! - **Rust to Python.** A CPython `bytes` object owns its storage inside its
//!   own allocation and there is no API — limited or otherwise — that adopts a
//!   foreign buffer. [`py_bytes`] therefore uses
//!   [`PyBytes::new`](pyo3::types::PyBytes::new), which allocates the object
//!   and copies the frame into it in one step. A `memoryview` over
//!   Rust-owned bytes would avoid the copy, and is deliberately **not** used
//!   here: the buffer protocol is not part of the limited API before CPython
//!   3.11, and B-058's wheel is `abi3` from 3.9 — a zero-copy path that only
//!   exists on some interpreters is a performance cliff, not a feature.
//!
//! `benches/bytes_boundary.rs` measures both directions at 0 B, 64 B, 1 KiB
//! and 1 MiB, and the numbers go into
//! [IMPLEMENTATION.md](../../../docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) rather than into a
//! sentence claiming the copy is cheap.
